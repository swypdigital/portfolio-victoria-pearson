### Weekly Check-ins (Self-Audit)
Every Sunday, review:
1. **Metrics:** Content views, outreach responses, meetings scheduled
2. **Revenue:** Deals in pipeline, contracts signed, income generated
3. **Energy:** What's energizing you? What's draining you?
4. **Adjustments:** What to double down on? What to cut?

### Monthly Milestones
- **Month 1 (Week 4):** Foundation complete, first meetings happening
- **Month 2 (Week 8):** First revenue generated, media appearances secured
- **Month 3 (Week 12):** Long-term income secured (employment or recurring consulting)

### Red Flags (When to Pivot)
- **Week 6:** If zero VC responses, pivot to direct employer outreach
- **Week 8:** If zero journalist responses, pivot to podcast-first + LinkedIn articles
- **Week 10:** If zero revenue, emergency consulting sprint + course launch
