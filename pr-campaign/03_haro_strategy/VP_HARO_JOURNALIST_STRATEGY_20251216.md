# HARO & JOURNALIST OUTREACH STRATEGY
## Victoria Pearson - PR Campaign Implementation Guide

**Generated:** December 16, 2025
**Purpose:** Step-by-step guide to securing media coverage through HARO and direct journalist outreach
**Target:** 5-10 media mentions in first 90 days
**Cost:** $0 (all free strategies)

---

## 🎯 STRATEGY OVERVIEW

### **Two-Pronged Approach:**

1. **HARO (Reactive):** Respond to journalist requests 3x daily
2. **Direct Outreach (Proactive):** Pitch 50+ journalists directly

### **Why This Works:**
- Journalists need sources → You're the perfect source
- Your story has 6+ newsworthy angles → Multiple placement opportunities
- Zero cost → Sustainable long-term strategy
- Compounds → Each mention makes next one easier

### **Expected Timeline:**
- **Week 1-2:** HARO responses, first pitches sent
- **Week 3-4:** First mention (likely smaller outlet)
- **Week 5-8:** 2-5 mentions (building momentum)
- **Week 9-12:** Major outlet placement (Forbes, TechCrunch level)

---

## 📧 PART 1: HARO STRATEGY

### **What is HARO?**

**Help A Reporter Out** (helpareporter.com) connects journalists with expert sources. Journalists post queries 3x daily, you respond with expertise, they feature you in articles.

**Why It Works:**
- FREE (always will be)
- 3 daily emails with 30-60 journalist queries each
- Journalists NEED sources to meet deadlines
- Your unique story = high response rate

### **Setup Instructions (5 Minutes):**

1. Go to: **helpareporter.com**
2. Click "Sign Up as a Source" (NOT "Sign Up as a Journalist")
3. Email: [Your Email]
4. Select Categories:
   - ✅ High Tech
   - ✅ Business & Finance
   - ✅ Lifestyle & Fitness (for age/wellness angles)
   - ✅ General (catch-all for diversity stories)
5. Verify email
6. Start receiving queries 3x daily (5:35am, 12:35pm, 5:35pm ET)

### **How to Scan HARO Emails (10 Minutes 3x Daily):**

**Ctrl+F Search for These Keywords:**
- AI (artificial intelligence)
- Machine learning
- Tech career
- Age discrimination
- Career change
- Self-taught
- Diversity
- Women in tech
- Senior workforce
- Automation
- Remote work
- Entrepreneurship

**Red Flags (Skip These):**
- Payment required to respond
- MLM/pyramid schemes
- Requests for free consulting (not quick quotes)
- Topics completely unrelated to your expertise

### **HARO Response Template:**

**Subject Line:** `RE: [Their Query Title] - 61yo Self-Taught AI Architect, $20M Portfolio`

```
Hi [Journalist Name],

I'd be happy to contribute to your story on [TOPIC].

QUICK BIO: I'm Victoria Pearson, a 61-year-old self-taught AI architect who built $8M-25M in production-grade systems in 12 months—with no computer science degree or coding experience. My portfolio includes AI interview coaching (InterviewPlus), patent-worthy content generation (GenCraft), and enterprise workflow automation (Claude OS).

RELEVANT INSIGHT FOR YOUR STORY:

[3-5 sentences directly answering their question, using your talking points]

I'm available for follow-up questions via email or phone. My full media kit is attached/linked [if requested].

### **Example HARO Response:**

**Query:** "Looking for experts on how AI is changing the job market for older workers"

**Your Response:**

```
Hi Sarah,

I'd be happy to contribute to your story on AI and older workers.

QUICK BIO: I'm Victoria Pearson, a 61-year-old African American woman who taught herself AI at age 60 with zero tech background and built a $20M IP portfolio in 12 months. My systems include production-grade applications valued individually at $1M-10M each.

RELEVANT INSIGHT FOR YOUR STORY:

The narrative is all wrong. Everyone focuses on "AI is taking jobs from older workers." But AI is the great equalizer. For the first time in history, you don't need 20 years of coding experience to build world-class software. Age is actually an asset—I bring decades of systems thinking that 25-year-olds don't have. AI handles the syntax; I handle the strategy.

But here's the urgency: this window is closing. In 2-3 years, AI fluency will be table stakes. Older workers who start learning TODAY will be ahead. Those who wait will be left behind. I'm proof at 61 that it's not too late—but you have to start now.

Happy to expand on this via phone or provide specific portfolio examples.

Best,
Victoria Pearson

### **HARO Success Metrics:**

**Week 1-2:** Send 10 responses
**Week 3-4:** Send 15 responses (getting faster)
**Week 5+:** Send 5-10/week consistently

**Conversion Rate:**
- 10-20% response rate from journalists (normal)
- 1 placement per 10-20 pitches (realistic)
- First placement often takes 15-30 responses (don't give up!)

### **HARO Pro Tips:**

1. **Speed Matters:** Respond within 2 hours of query going out (journalists work on tight deadlines)
2. **Be Specific:** Generic responses get ignored; specific, quotable insights get used
3. **Include Numbers:** "$20M portfolio" is more compelling than "valuable portfolio"
4. **Offer Photos:** "High-res headshots available upon request" = more likely to use you
5. **Follow Up:** If they don't respond in 48 hours, send ONE polite follow-up
6. **Track Everything:** Spreadsheet of query, journalist, response date, outcome

## 📰 PART 2: DIRECT JOURNALIST OUTREACH

### **Why Direct Outreach:**

HARO is reactive (you respond to their needs). Direct outreach is proactive (you initiate the pitch). Combined approach = 3-5x more placements.

### **How to Follow Up:**

**Follow-Up Email Template:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my email from [Date] about my story: 61-year-old self-taught AI architect with $20M portfolio.

I know you're busy, so quick question: Is this something that might work for [Publication], or should I redirect this pitch to another editor/reporter?

Just published a blog post expanding on this if helpful: [Link]

Thanks,
Victoria
```

**Rules:**
- Only follow up ONCE (unless they engage)
- Keep it short (3 sentences max)
- Give them an out ("or should I redirect?")
- Don't be pushy—journalists remember annoying sources

---

## 💡 ADVANCED TACTICS

### **Tactic 1: The Exclusive**
Offer one major outlet an exclusive 24-48 hours before pitching others.

**Email:** "I'm offering Forbes first exclusive on this story for 48 hours. If it doesn't fit, I'll pitch elsewhere on Thursday."

**Why It Works:** Creates urgency + flatters them with "first dibs"

---

### **Tactic 2: The News Hook**
Tie your pitch to breaking news.

**Example:** If Anthropic announces Claude Code update → pitch immediately: "I built $20M using Claude Code—here's how the new features will democratize AI further"

---

### **Tactic 3: The Data Angle**
Reference recent studies/reports in your pitch.

**Example:** "McKinsey just reported AI will displace 12M jobs by 2030. I'm proof those workers can reinvent themselves—but here's the catch..."

---

### **Tactic 4: The Seasonal Angle**
Tie to calendar events.

- **January:** "New Year career change stories"
- **March:** Women's History Month
- **May:** Older Americans Month
- **September:** Back-to-school (learning theme)
- **December:** Year-in-review, inspirational stories

---

### **Tactic 5: The LinkedIn Strategy**
Connect with journalists on LinkedIn first, engage with their posts for 1-2 weeks, THEN send pitch via LinkedIn message.

**Why It Works:** You're not a stranger anymore

---

## 🎓 JOURNALIST RESEARCH TIPS

### **Before Emailing ANY Journalist:**

1. **Read 3-5 of their recent articles** (know their beat)
2. **Check their Twitter** (learn their interests/personality)
3. **Note their pitch preferences** (some say "no DMs," respect that)
4. **Find common ground** (mention specific article you liked)

### **Red Flags (Don't Pitch These People):**
- Haven't written in 6+ months (they likely moved outlets)
- Explicitly say "Don't pitch me" in bio
- Completely different beat (don't pitch AI to fashion reporter)

---

```
Hi [Partner Name],

I'm Victoria Pearson - 61-year-old self-taught AI architect with a pre-revenue IP portfolio valued at $8M-25M (based on replacement cost, comparable SaaS valuations, and licensing potential).

WHAT I'VE BUILT:
- GenCraft/Maverick Stack: Model-agnostic meta-generation engine (my strategic asset)
- InterviewPlus: AI interview coaching platform ($2M-4M estimated value)
- TokenCalc: AI cost calculator ($1M-3M)
- Claude OS: Enterprise workflow automation ($100K-500K/year consulting value)
- Plus BookCraft and LeadCraft

THE OPPORTUNITY FOR [FIRM NAME]:
I see 3-5 companies in your portfolio that could benefit from licensing GenCraft/Maverick Stack:
- [Portfolio Co #1]: [How it helps]
- [Portfolio Co #2]: [How it helps]
- [Portfolio Co #3]: [How it helps]

PROPOSED STRUCTURE (TWO OPTIONS):

**Option A - Portfolio Licensing:**
$50K-100K per company license = $250K-500K total for 5 companies
Your portfolio companies get competitive AI infrastructure, I get revenue + validation

**Option B - Hybrid Hire-Buy:**
Hire me as Principal/Staff Architect for one portfolio company ($250K-400K comp)
+ Acquire IP ($500K-1M signing bonus)
+ License GenCraft to rest of portfolio

I've spent thousands of hours building these systems. Now I'm ready to monetize through the right strategic partnership.

### **VC OUTREACH STRATEGY:**

**Week 1-2:**
- Research 5 VCs from Tier 1-2 (focus on portfolio fit)
- Identify 3-5 portfolio companies per VC that could use GenCraft
- Customize pitch for each (specific portfolio company examples)

**Week 3-4:**
- Send 5 pitches (1 per day, well-researched)
- Follow up after 7 days if no response
- LinkedIn connection requests to partners

**Week 5-8:**
- Expand to 10 more VCs
- Leverage any responses to create FOMO ("2 other firms interested")
- Request intro calls, prepare demo

**Success Metrics:**
- 5 pitches sent = 1-2 responses expected
- 1 intro call = potential for licensing discussion
- 1 licensing deal = $50K-150K quick revenue (transforms cash flow)

---

### **WHY THIS WORKS:**

1. **VCs Love Portfolio Synergies:** Helping 5 companies at once = high ROI
2. **De-Risks for VCs:** You're not asking for investment, just licensing fees
3. **Proof of Concept:** Working systems, not vaporware
4. **Unique Story:** 61yo self-taught = PR value for VC (diversity, innovation)
5. **Quick Revenue for You:** $50K-500K in 60-90 days vs. 6-month job search
