## 🎯 COURSE PHILOSOPHY

### Core Beliefs
1. **AI Democratizes Software Development** - You don't need a CS degree to build production systems
2. **Age Is An Asset** - Life experience = better product sense + systems thinking
3. **Learning By Building** - Theory is useless without application
4. **Community Over Competition** - Cohort accountability accelerates learning

### Who This Course Is For
**Ideal Students:**
- **Age 20-30:** No clear career path, drowning in uncertainty
- **Age 30-45:** Mortgage + kids, recent layoff, desperate to pivot
- **Age 50-60+:** Written off by employers, need second act income
- **All Ages:** College educated but degree leads nowhere

**Prerequisites:**
- ❌ **NO** programming experience required
- ❌ **NO** technical background required
- ✅ **YES** to willingness to learn and daily practice (2-3 hours/day minimum)
- ✅ **YES** to having a computer (Mac/Windows/Linux)
