## PENDING TASKS FROM QUANTUM TODO:
```
 [ ] ✅ COMPLETE: ChatGPT Conversations Analysis - 795 lines, MOECRAFT + 43 verticals + advanced features
 [ ] 📊 PHASE 1: Progress tracking system created (3% complete - 1/36 items)
 [ ] ✅ COMPLETE: GroklyGroup Frameworks Analysis - Found 14+ frameworks to leverage
 [ ] PHASE 1.3: Update gap analysis with Phase 1 findings and regenerate reports
 [ ] PHASE 1.2: Analyze MAVERICK STACK architecture patterns
 [ ] PHASE 1.1: Analyze GroklyGroup FRAMEWORKS directory (enterprise testing/anti-hallucination/security)
 [ ] 🚨 CRITICAL PRIORITY: Complete PHASE 1 data gathering before any implementation (currently 9.5% complete)
 [ ] V3.0 TERMINOLOGY: Use Control Panel (not Observation Deck) for delegated limited management UI - separate from SuperAdmin God Mode
 [ ] V3.0 REQ: GenCraft tokens - system MUST adapt output to stay within god-set maximum cost threshold (sitewide setting, per-user override by site owner)
 [ ] V3.0 REQ: BYOK users override ALL god settings for cost - unlimited budget because they pay for their own tokens
 [ ] V3.0 REQ: Replace SuperAdmin terminology with Control Panel (observation deck with limited management), separate SuperAdmin role for God Mode site owner
 [ ] V3.0 REQ: Cost rejection ONLY when using GenCraft tokens (not BYOK)
 [ ] V3.0 REQ: BYOK users - NEVER reject based on cost, adapt output to stay within threshold (sitewide setting, per-user override by site owner)
 [ ] V3.0 DECISION NEEDED: Implement SOS system (like InterviewPlus) for user safety?
 [ ] V3.0 REQ: Retry failures generate reports (no manual intervention required)
 [ ] V3.0 REQ: NO manual approval anywhere - system retries up to 5 times (not 3), decides retry based on failure reason (TOS violation, bad actor, wrong LLM, etc)
