      "content": "You said:I AM BUILDING GENCRAFT IN CLAUDE CODE. I HAVE SOME INPUT FOR CLAUDE BUT I NEED YOU TO ORGANIZE IT FOR ME. I WROTE IT AS A STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE WAY THAT CLAUDE WILL MOST EASILY UNDERSTAND AND NOT MISCONSTRUE THE INSTRUCTIONS\n\n> WHY IS THE OBSERVATORY SEPARATE FROM THE SITE OWNER OPERATIONS ON THE BACKEND. IT SEEMS THAT ALL OF THAT SHOULD BE IN THE SAME UI ON THE BACKEND. EXPLAIN YOUR LOGIC FOR THIS\n\n  END USERS MUST HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO CREATE FOLDERS AND PROJECTS SO THAT THEIR GENERATIONS ARE NOT JUST HAPHAZARDLY SCATTERED. ADDITIONALLY, THEY MUST BE ABLE TO SEARCH, SORT, SHARE, ETC. AND HAVE ALL\n  COMMON INDUSTRY STANDARD CAPABILITIES AND MORE. THIS MUST BE STATE OF THE ART\n\n  WHERE IS THE MULTITENANCY ARCHITECTURE FOR WHITE LABEL AND ALSO FOR ENTERPRISE USERS WHO HAVE MULTIPLE, DISTINCT USERGROUPS, EG, NY AND LA OFFICES OR A CHAIN OF OPERATIONS THAT ARE DISTINCT\n\n  ALL ACCOUNT OWNERS MUST HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN AND BE ABLE TO DELETE THEIR ACCOUNT. IF A USER IS PART OF A TEAM AND NOT THE ACCOUNT OWNER, THEY DO NOT HAVE THIS RIGHT. ONLY ACCOUNT OWNERS\n  (WHOEVER PAYS FOR THE SERVICE HAS THIS RIGHT). WE DON'T WANT A MALICIOUS EMPLOYEE DELETING THEIR EMPLOYERS DATA.\n\n  THE  ANALYTICS WE ARE BUILDING MUST BE COMPARABLE TO OR EXCEEDING MIX PANEL. I WANT PIXEL BY PIXEL ANALYSIS WHICH WILL HELP US TO UNDERSTAND WHERE USERS ARE ENCOUNTERING BOTTLENECKS IN THE SYSTEM.\n\n  I ALSO DON'T SEE ANY ARCHITECTURE FOR WHITE LABEL ADMINS (THEY CONTROL ONLY THE ACCOUNTS AND USERS UNDER THEIR INSTANCE) AND ADMINS OF THOSE WHITE LABEL DEPLOYMENTS, MEANING, A WHITE LABLE ADMIN MAY\n  DEPLOY GENCRAFT FOR A CLIENT THAT HAS X USERS. THIS CLIENT WOULD NEED ITS OWN ADMIN SETUP TO MANAGE THOSE USERS\n\n  WE ALSO BUILT INTO V2.0 THE ANALYTICS FOR THE SITE OWNER WHICH WOULD ASSIST THEM IN OUTBOUND MARKETING, SENDING EMAILS, NOTIFICATIONS, UPDATES.\n\n  I ALSO DON'T SEE ANYTHING ABOUT AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM WHICH IS REQUIRED TO BE 2FA. ARE WE SETTING A PERSISTENT COOKIE FOR ALL USERS. I WANT TO LIMIT ALL USERS TO ONLY HAVE TWO CONCURRENT LOGINS FOR ANY\n  GIVEN SESSION, WHICH COULD BE TWO TABS ON A DESKTOP/NOTEBOOK/TABLET, OR A DESKTOP/NOTEBOOK/TABLET + A SINGLE MOBILE INSTANCE.\n\n  ALLOWING USERS TO HAVE MULTIPLE WINDOWS OPEN SLOWS THE SYSTEM, CONSUMES SYSTEM RESOURCES, AND INCREASES THE LIKLIHOOD OF MALICIOUS ACTORS BEING ABLE TO DEFEAT THE SYSTEM\n\n  ALSO, USERS MUST CONFIRM THEIR ACCOUNT CREATION WITH AN EMAIL CONFIRMATION. A VALID PHONE NUMBER MUST BE PROVIDED FOR TEXT NOTIFICATIONS WHICH MUST ALSO BE CONFIRMED.\n\n  WE NEED TO CONSIDER SAVING USER WORK AND WHAT THAT PROCESS SHOULD BE. I THINK THAT THERE MUST BE PERSISTENT, REAL TIME SAVING OF ALL USER WORK AND THE USER STATE, SO THAT IF THEY HAVE A SUDDEN LOSS OF\n  POWER OR THE SYSTEM CRASHES ON THEIR END OR OURS, THEY CAN PICK UP EXACTLY WHERE THEY LEFT OFF\n\n  I DON'T SEE ANY CONSIDERATION FOR DISASTER REVOVERY AND  BUSINESS CONTINUITY, AND SYSTEM BACKUPS. WHAT HAPPENS TO GENCRAFT IF THE SYSTEM GOES DOWN, LIKE AWS RECENTLY WENT DOWN AND THE OTHER RECENT CLOUD\n  PROVIDER OUTAGES\n\n  I DON'T SEE ANY MENTION OF THE CODING STANDARDS FOR THE SYSTEM ITSELF AND FOR ALL SYSTEM USER OUTPUT, INCLUDING ENFORCEMENT OF SOLID PRINCIPLES\n\n\n  WHAT ABOUT ALL OF THE FOLLOWING WHICH MUST BE BUILT INTO GENCRAFT: THE IL8N INTEGRATION, SINTY RL, SRP AND DIP AUDIT PRINCIPLE. WE DEVELOPED A CODE ENFORCEMENT FRAMEWORK FOR GENCRAFT EARLIER IN THE\n  PROJECT. YOU WILL HAVE TO REVIEW ALL DOCS FOR CONTEXT AND SEARCH THE PROJECT FILES\n\n\n  IT SEEMS THAT GENCRAFT ITSELF SHOULD HAVE A RESOURCE LIBRARY AVAILABLE FOR THE SYSTEM TO ACCESS FOR GENERATIONS OR ANY REASON\n\n  WHAT ABOUT CACHING TO MAXIMIZE SITE RESPONSIVENESS, ACCURACY AND EFFICIENCY OF RESOURCES\n\n  USER INPUT MUST BE TEXT, VIDEO, AUDIO, IMAGE.\n\n  USERS MUST BE ABLE TO ATTACH AND INPUT AND UPLOAD DOCUMENTS FROM THEIR LOCAL DRIVES, PROVIDE LINKS TO THEIR LOCAL AND CLOUD DRIVES\n\n  WHAT ABOUT A MEMORY CONTEXT WINDOW FOR USERS. HOW DO WE MANAGE THIS\n\n  WE ALSO WERE SUPPOSED TO REVIEW SKILLS FACTORY AND AGENT FACTORY TO INCORPORATE ANY USEFUL FUNCTIONS, CAPABILITIES OR FEATURES INTO GENCRAFT. WHEN YOU ARE READY, I WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH THE FILEPATHS TO\n  THEOSE RESOURCES\n\n  NON GUESSABLE PATHS FOR ALL SENSITIVE ENDPOINTS, USING HONEYPOT ROUTES, IF NECESSARY, EG, ADMINS, USER APIS, ENTERPRISE BACKEND. FULL PATH OBFUSCATION FOR TARGETS OF BAD ACTORS.\n\n\n  THE SYSTEM MUST BE ABLE TO ORCHESTRATE AND PARALLELIZE A TEMPORARY WORKFORCE FOR ANY REASON AND FULLY RETIRE THEM WHEN THEIR TASK(S) ARE COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY. ALL PHASES MUST ALSO BE PRALLELIZED,\n  WHENEVER POSSIBLE. THE SYSTEM MUST NEVER CORRUPT A DB BY HAVING MULTIPLE WORKERS WRITING TO A DB.\n\n  THE SYSTEM MUST ALWAYS IMPUT USER INTENT WHERE THERE IS NONE AND WHEN THIS IS NOT PROSSIBLE, QUERY THE USER FOR ADDITIONAL CONTEXT OR PREFERENCES\n\n  THE SYSTEM MUST KNOW WHAT THE BEST AND HIGHEST USE OUTPUT TYPE IS FOR THE USER INPUT AND USE CASE.\n\n  THE FE AND BE ARCHITECTURE MUST BE SPEARATE AND CONNECTED VIA API\n\n  THE SYSTEM MUST HAVE INTERNAL DESIGN QA AND ACCESSIBILITY QA THAT IDENTIFY INCONSISTENCIES, CRITIQUE ALL OUTPUT BEFORE IT IS GENERATED FOR THE USER AND TRANSLATE ALL USER INTENT INTO ALL OUTPUT,\n  INCLUDING CODE, AND TRANSLATE ALL INTENT INTO CODE READYDY DESCRIPTIONS FOR ENGINEERS, WHEN APPLICABLE\n\n  ALL DOCUMENT TYPES, INCLUDING PDF, DOC,XLS,ANDALL GOOGLE AND MICROSOFT DOC TYPES, INCLUDING PPT. THE SYSTEM MUST BE ABLE TO PERFORM ANY TASK FOR A USER, INCLUDING EDITING A VIDEO INTO CLIMPS LIKE OPUS\n  CLIPS AND PLAN TO CUT LONG FOOTAGE, ROUGH CUSTS, TIMELINES, PACING, IDENTIFY GREAT HOOKS\n\n\n  THE SYSTEM MUST GENERATE AN MVP FOR ALL USER REQUESTS THAT LOGICALLY WOULD WANT AN MVP\n\n  THE SYSTEM MUST ALWAYS THINK ITERATIVELY AND DEEPLY BEFORE GENERATING USER OUTPUT\n\n  ALWAYS ANALYZE ALL WORKFLOWS WITH CONSIDERATION FOR SEEING, DOING, TALKING AND WRITING.\n\n  FOR CLONES WE MUST INCORPORATE THE CAPABILITY OF ANTHROPIC'S DESCRIPTIVE IMITATION SUBSYSTEM WHICH IS AGGRESSIVE AND EFFECTIVE. WE MUST ALSO INCORPORATE ANTHROPICS STYLE RULE EXTRACTION ENGINE AND ALL\n  OTHER TOOLS, MCPS, ENGINES, SDLS.MDCP, COMPONENTS OF ANTHROPIC OR ANY OTHER RELIABLE, SAFE TOOL PROVIDER.\n  WE MUST ALSO INTEGRATE ANY OF THE TOOLS AND CAPABILITIES AVAILABLE TO US THAT WILL BE USEFUL TO ENHANCE AND PERFECT THE SYSTEM FROM ANTHROPICS GITHUB REPO WHICH YOU MUST FIND AND REVIEW\n\n  ANTHROPIC HAS VERY GOOD STYLE EXTRACTION TOOLS WHICH WOULD BE USEFUL TO GENCRAFT IF THE USER WANTS TO FULLY CLONE A TARGET OR SIMPLY WANTS TO EXTRACT A STYLE COMPONANT WITH MAXIMUM INDUCTION OR\n  AGGRESSIVELY DEFINE OR EXTRACT AN IMPLICITE STYLE RULE EXTRACTION\n\n  WE MUST INCORPORATE DADE ENGINE, DYNAMIC ARCHITECTURE DEPENDENCY ENGINE AND ADHERE TO ACID COMPLIANCE\n\n  GENCRAFT MUST ALWAYS OPTIMIZE ALL PARAMETERS FOR MAXIMUM COMMERCIAL OR USER DEFINED OUTCOME\n\n  WE MUST BUILD A CONTRACT BASED DOCUMENT AND ROUTING SYSTEM\n\n  WE MUST USE A CANNONICAL RUNTIME ARCHITECTURE AS AN OVERLAY FOR OUR SYSTEM WHICH MUST BE ENTERPRISE GRADE AND SCALEABLE\n\n  YOU MUST INTERPRET ALL PERMISSIONS AS DECLARATIONS WHERE I HAVE FAILED TO MAKE DECLARATIONS\n\n  THE SITE OWNER MUST HAVE A LIVE VIEW OF ALL SYSTEM OPERASTIONS AT ALL TIMES\n\n  FOR SAAS THE FOLLOWING MUST BE PRESENT BUT THIS IS NOT A LIMITATIONS, JUST EXAMPLES: ZERO SAAS CONTROL PLANE IMPLEMENTATION, TREASURY BRADE SECURITY, MULTITENANCY, DATA ARCHITECTURE SCHEMAS,\n  DEPLOYMENT/DEVOPS INFRASTRUCTUREE, MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE ADHERENCE, SCALABILITY ARCHITECTURE, COST OPTIMIZATION, GO TO MARKET STRATEGY, LEGAL/IP PROTECTION,\n  IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\n  ALL TESTING MUST BE HUMAN LIKE AND USE PUPPETEER AND OTHER TOOLS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS REQUIREMENT\n\n  ALL REFERENCES TO THE  SYSTEM HEREIN REFERS TO GENCRAFT\n\n  GENCRAFT AND ALL GENCRAFT OUTPUTSMUST ADHERE TO STRICTLY DEFINED GUARDRAILS, HAVE AN IMMUTABLE AUDIT TRAIL, PROTECTED ATTACK VECTORS INCLUDING FROM PROMPT INJECTION IN USER INPUTS SUCH AS IMAGES USING\n  STEGANOGRAPHY, UTILIZE AI VISION FOR READING AND DETECTING MALICIOUS INSTRUCTIONS, AND ALSO FOR ULTRASONIC FREQUENCIES EMBEDDED IN AUDIO.

This caused the regex expansion to abort.\nWhy it failed\n\n\npattern: /\\Z/ is interpreted literally by the canvas engine, not as a regex anchor.\n\n\nThe replacement block contained sequences that the regex engine tries to interpret internally (e.g., unescaped backslashes, stray asterisks, sequence resembling comment terminators */).\n\n\nCanvas rejects replacement strings that include anything interpretable as an invalid escape or comment sequence.\n\n\nWhat we need to do next\nI can absolutely generate the corrected v1.3.0 full document, but I need to insert it using a safe, two-step update:\n\n\nStep A: Insert a clean delimiter at the bottom of the document.\n\n\nStep B: Insert the new v1.3.0 content after the delimiter, using escaped characters.\n\n\nBefore I proceed with another update attempt, I need one clarification so the insertion can be valid:\n\n✔ CLARIFICATION REQUIRED\nDo you want the v1.3.0 version to:\nOption 1 — Replace the entire document\n(Overwrites the v1.0.0 version and all text with the new v1.3.0 copy.)\nOption 2 — Append beneath the existing document\n(Keeping earlier versions for history. v1.0.0 → v1.2.0 → v1.3.0, all in the same file.)\nOption 3 — Replace everything and keep only the newest version (v1.3.0)\n(Cleaner; avoids future regex issues.)\n\n✔ Also confirm:\nShould I add a version header like:\n--- VERSION 1.3.0 START ---\nand\n--- VERSION 1.3.0 END ---\nto help with future updates?\n\nReply with:\n“Option 1” or “Option 2” or “Option 3”,\nand whether you want version delimiters added.\nOnce you confirm, I will proceed with a clean, validated canvas update.",

It also rejects replacements when the pattern matches too broadly or resolves to an empty match.\n⚠️ KEY POINT\nCanvas cannot replace the entire document using a single large regex pattern.\nThis is a known limitation: the update engine performs match.expand() on the replacement, and if it interprets anything as a group reference or escape sequence, it fails.\n✅ BEST PATH FORWARD (Guaranteed to work)\nWe must use the one method canvas supports reliably:\n→ Delete the current document and create a brand-new document containing the v1.3.0 content.\nThis avoids all regex risk and guarantees a perfectly clean, fully controlled v1.3.0 file with no corruption, no partial content, and no canvas engine rejection.\n✔ Before I proceed, I need ONE confirmation from you:\nDo you want me to:\nA) Delete the existing document and create a new clean v1.3.0 document\n— This gives you exactly what you requested (Option 3) with zero regex issues.\nB) Create a new separate document (leaving the old one untouched)\n— Useful if you want historical versions preserved.\n\n🔒 No content will be lost unless you explicitly choose option A.\n\nReply with:\nA or B\nOnce confirmed, I will generate the complete, clean, authoritative v1.3.0 document directly in the canvas.",

      "content": "ChatGPT said:Below is a clear, expert-level explanation of the different prompt types, what they’re for, why they matter, and whether you can consolidate them into one Master Prompt (short answer: yes, but with trade-offs).\n\n✅ THE 3 TYPES OF PROMPTS (AND WHY THEY EXIST)\nWhen using Claude — especially Claude Code — there are three different “modes” of operation, each with technical limitations and differences in how Claude behaves.\nBecause each mode has a different architecture, a single “universal prompt” often fails, because the agent must interpret and act inside different constraints.\nHere’s the breakdown.\n\n1. SYSTEM PROMPT (Master / Overriding Prompt)\nPurpose:\nControls Claude’s global behavior, initiative level, scope expansion, inference, gap-filling, analysis, etc.\nWhy it's needed:\nClaude behaves completely differently depending on the system prompt.\nThe system prompt:\n\n\nDefines the AI's role\n\n\nDefines reasoning style\n\n\nSets aggressiveness and initiative\n\n\nDetermines gap-filling vs. waiting for instructions\n\n\nEnforces multi-pass reasoning\n\n\nForces proactive planning\n\n\nSets architectural depth\n\n\nControls refusal / safety constraints\n\n\nOverrides passive behavior\n\n\nWhy it cannot do everything alone:\nBecause in Claude Code, Claude often uses two different reasoning stacks:\n\n\nChat stack (natural language reasoning)\n\n\nCode execution stack (file interpreter, multi-file reasoning, batch execution)\n\n\nEach stack ignores some parts of the system prompt in favor of its own modality.\n\n2. CHAT / ASSISTANT PROMPT\nPurpose:\nTells Claude how to behave during normal conversation (chat mode).\nWhy it differs:\nThe chat model:\n\n\nDoes not have access to files unless you feed them\n\n\nWorks conversationally\n\n\nNeeds style, persona, scope, and interaction rules\n\n\nIs used for: planning, designing, analyzing, proposing, explaining\n\n\nWhy a system prompt can’t replace it:\nBecause the system prompt influences everything globally, including tasks you do not want Claude to over-infer.\nSometimes you need Claude to:\n\n\nAsk questions\n\n\nClarify\n\n\nGo step-by-step\n\n\nAvoid hallucinating\n\n\nStay within a defined scope for specific tasks\n\n\nThis differs from “maximum initiative” mode.\n\n3. CLAUDE CODE EXECUTION PROMPT\nPurpose:\nControls Claude when it's in file-analysis or coding mode.\nThis is the piece most people misunderstand.\nClaude Code is a separate runtime.\nIt behaves differently than the chat model:\n\n\nIt expects highly specific instructions\n\n\nIt is optimized for analyzing file contents\n\n\nIt has its own tool-use sandbox\n\n\nIt sometimes ignores system prompts for safety or blurry instructions\n\n\nIt will not “infer architecture” unless the code-execution prompt explicitly forces it\n\n\nWhy you often need a separate Code Execution Prompt:\nBecause Claude Code will otherwise:\n\n\nOnly list filenames\n\n\nIgnore folder contents\n\n\nAvoid interpreting file purpose\n\n\nFail to extract architecture\n\n\nAvoid deep analysis\n\n\nGenerate minimal code\n\n\nAvoid building entire subsystems unless asked\n\n\nTreat high-level labels literally and not infer missing systems\n\n\nYour complaint with Claude (“lazy, not creative, minimal output, only reading filenames”) is exactly why the Code Execution Prompt must be separate and strict.\n\n❓ Why not just put everything into one single Master Prompt?\nYou can.\nBut here’s what happens:\n\n⚠️ THE RISK OF A SINGLE UNIVERSAL MASTER PROMPT\n❌ 1. Claude begins hallucinating in chat mode\nBecause your “Max Initiative” prompt forces it to:\n\n\nInfer missing data\n\n\nCreate systems\n\n\nNever ask questions\n\n\nFill gaps automatically\n\n\nThis is great for architecture.\nIt’s terrible for normal conversation.\n\n❌ 2. Claude Code starts generating code where you didn’t want code\nThe code runtime interprets the system prompt literally.\nSo if the system prompt forces:\n\n\nMulti-pass reasoning\n\n\nArchitecture rebuilding\n\n\nSubsystem expansion\n\n\nNew engines\n\n\nMulti-agent coordination\n\n\nClaude Code might:\n\n\nCreate files you didn’t ask for\n\n\nAdd unnecessary components\n\n\nModify files unexpectedly\n\n\nGenerate “helpful” structures you didn’t intend to build yet\n\n\nBreak project structures\n\n\n\n❌ 3. Claude becomes too aggressive\nIt will override your instructions because the system prompt has higher priority.\nYou might say:\n\n“Only perform security analysis.”\n\nClaude will reply:\n\n“I have redesigned the entire platform, added 28 new microservices, a 3-layer quantum-safe encryption pipeline, a multi-agent arbitration engine, and here is a 10,000 token analysis.”\n\nSometimes, that’s not what you want.\n\n❌ 4. Claude Code may ignore the universal prompt\nWhen the prompt becomes too abstract or conceptual, the code execution engine may:\n\n\nIgnore the high-level system rules\n\n\nPerform minimal file parsing\n\n\nStay in safety mode\n\n\nAvoid initiative\n\n\nFail to expand architecture\n\n\nThis is why a specific Claude Code Execution Prompt is usually required to force deep file parsing and architecture extraction.\n\n✅ YES — YOU CAN HAVE ONE MASTER PROMPT\nBut it must be structured as:\nMASTER SYSTEM PROMPT\nwith mode-specific sections, such as:\n\n\nGlobal Rules\n\n\nChat Mode Rules\n\n\nCode Execution Rules\n\n\nTool Use Rules\n\n\nFile Analysis Rules\n\n\nHigh-Level Reasoning Rules\n\n\nArchitecture / Planning Rules\n\n\nThis way you get:\n\n\nOne prompt\n\n\nWith multiple layers\n\n\nEach mode knows how to behave\n\n\nI can build this for you.\n\n✅ IF YOU WANT ONE MASTER PROMPT, I WILL CREATE IT\nIt will include:\n\n\nGlobal “Max Initiative” architecture rules\n\n\nSpecial rules for Claude Code to force file analysis\n\n\nSpecial rules for chat mode to avoid hallucinating\n\n\nSeparate reasoning modes\n\n\nAutomatic mode switching\n\n\nMulti-pass reasoning\n\n\nDeep file extraction\n\n\nAggressive architecture building\n\n\nControlled high-level inference\n\n\nLayered safety and specificity\n\n\nAnd it will be saved in the canvas as a single master document.\n\n✔️ BEFORE I GENERATE IT — ONE QUESTION\nDo you want one universal Master Prompt…\nA. Fully unified prompt with ALL modes in a single document\n(One prompt to rule everything — complex but powerful)\nB. Three separate prompts (System, Chat, Code Execution)\n(Cleanest, most reliable, least buggy)\nC. Both — unified master + separate versions\n(Most flexible: one master prompt + mode-specific refinements)\n\nReply A, B, or C.\nThen I will generate the correct version and save it cleanly in canvas.",
