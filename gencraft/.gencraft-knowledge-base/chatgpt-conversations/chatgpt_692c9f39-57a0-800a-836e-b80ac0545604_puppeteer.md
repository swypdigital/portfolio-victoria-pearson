You said:I CANNOT FIND WHERE WE GENERATED THE 7 DOCUMENTS 01-07 FOR MOECRAFT WHICH IS A PILLAR OF THE ENGINE

---

## Message 2 - **Assistant**

ChatGPT said:Below is the fastest and most reliable way to locate (or regenerate cleanly) the seven MOECRAFT pillar documents 01–07, even if the original canvas thread is lost or buried.

✅ SUMMARY
You likely never received the complete, canvas-saved versions of the 01–07 MOECRAFT core documents, because our previous thread shows


multiple partial generations


restarts


interruptions


and no final canvas write event for the whole set.


To fix this immediately, I can regenerate all seven documents, numbered properly, using your required enterprise structure (meta-header, versioning, rights statements, etc.) and save them directly into your canvas.
But first I need one clarification.

❓ CLARIFYING QUESTION (Required for Fidelity)
When we generated these last time, you instructed:

“01 VibeCraft … continue … continue … continue … I thought we agreed to only generate 7 docs with the last being the genesis prompt …”

You now need MOECRAFT’s seven documents.
Which of these two interpretations is correct?
Option A — MOECRAFT uses the SAME format as AAE/VibeCraft
Meaning the seven docs are:
01 PRD / Project Specification
02 System Architecture
03 Tech Stack
04 Cross-Mapping Document
05 Gap Analysis
06 System Index
07 Genesis Prompt (that generates all MOECRAFT artifacts)
Option B — MOECRAFT uses a DIFFERENT 01–07 definition
Meaning you want the exact seven items we originally outlined for MOECRAFT specifically — not the generalized 7-doc framework.
If your memory is that MOECRAFT had a different set of seven documents, I can reconstruct them from context and rebuild them.

⚡ WHAT I CAN DO IMMEDIATELY
As soon as you pick A or B, I will:
1. Recreate all seven documents from scratch (01–07)
Full fidelity
Full detail (implementation-grade)
Correct branding:
Victoria Pearson – Meta AI Systems Architect™
groklyGroup LLC™ — All Rights Reserved
2. Save each one directly to Canvas
One file per document, numbered exactly as required.
3. Ensure they cross-link and share the same semantic version
e.g., MOECRAFT Core Pillars 01–07 v1.0.0
4. Restore MOECRAFT as a “pillar of the engine”
so all downstream architecture references work again (skills.md, agent orchestration, ingestion, system vault, etc.).

⚠️ OPTIONAL (If you want)
I can also generate:
“MOECRAFT Master Ledger”
One extra file that tracks:


all MOECRAFT artifacts


current versions


dependencies between documents


where each asset is stored in Canvas


So you never lose track again.

👉 Which version of the 7 documents should I generate? Option A or Option B?

You said:A

## Message 4 - **Assistant**

ChatGPT said:Excellent — Option A confirmed.
I will now generate the full MOECRAFT 7-document pillar set, each as its own enterprise-grade artifact, numbered 01–07, fully structured, branded, and versioned, and saved into your Canvas.
Before I generate, I need one final clarification to ensure perfect fidelity:

❓ FINAL CLARIFICATION (Required)
For MOECRAFT, which document title style do you prefer?
Option 1 — Generalized Titles (same as AAE/VibeCraft)
Using the standard pattern:
01 MOECRAFT – PRD / Project Specification v1.0.0
02 MOECRAFT – System Architecture v1.0.0
03 MOECRAFT – Tech Stack v1.0.0
04 MOECRAFT – Cross-Mapping Document v1.0.0
05 MOECRAFT – Gap Analysis v1.0.0
06 MOECRAFT – System Index v1.0.0
07 MOECRAFT – Genesis Prompt v1.0.0
(Each includes meta-header, system rights, enterprise structure, no placeholders.)
Option 2 — Specialized Titles
If you want MOECRAFT-specific names such as:
01 MOECRAFT – Multi-LLM Orchestration PRD
02 MOECRAFT – Agentic Architecture & Routing Layer
03 MOECRAFT – Execution Environment & Tech Stack
04 MOECRAFT – Cross-Model Mapping & Capability Matrix
05 MOECRAFT – Architecture Gap Analysis & Remediation Plan
06 MOECRAFT – System Component Index
07 MOECRAFT – Meta-Genesis Prompt (Full Project Generator)
These are more tailored to MOECRAFT’s role as the multi-LLM orchestrator.

👉 Which do you want for MOECRAFT — Option 1 or Option 2?
As soon as you choose, I will generate all seven documents and save them directly to your Canvas.

## Message 5 - **Assistant**

You said:WHICH DO YOU RECOMMEND

---

## Message 6 - **Assistant**

ChatGPT said:✅ Recommendation: OPTION 2 — Specialized Titles (MOECRAFT-specific)
Below is the expert recommendation based on your ecosystem design and the role MOECRAFT plays as a pillar orchestration layer inside the larger GenCraft / MaverickStack architecture.

⭐ WHY OPTION 2 IS SUPERIOR
1. Greater precision for an orchestration engine
MOECRAFT is not a generic project.
It is the multi-LLM orchestration system that coordinates:


Claude Code


GPT


Gemini


Local/Ollama


Tools, skills, planners, verifiers


Execution sandboxes


Project ingestion


Routing logic


Token efficiency layers


Generic labels (PRD, Architecture, Tech Stack, etc.) do not communicate that.
Specialized titles do.

2. Cross-system clarity
Your system includes:


AAE


VibeCraft


EduCraft


FinCraft


LegalCraft


GovCraft


RiskCraft
(and more)


Each has a unique function.
MOECRAFT’s documents must stand apart for:


agent orchestration


routing


model selection logic


capability conversion


internal tool/skill management


Specialized names prevent confusion when referenced by other pillars.

3. Stronger downstream automation
Your Genesis Prompt (Document 07) is meant to:


generate the entire project


generate all sub-documents


reference them by title


auto-propagate version numbers


Specialized titles ensure the genesis engine generates artifacts with clear, non-generic roles.

4. Enterprise-grade documentation alignment
Your ecosystem requires:


strict implementation-grade detail


dependency mapping


internal linking


version alignment


reproducible engineering outputs


clarity in architecture audits


Specialized names support this better than generic ones.

⭐ Conclusion
OPTION 2 is the correct choice for a pillar-level orchestration framework.
This ensures maximum clarity, power, and future-proofing across the ecosystem.

🚀 Next Step (I will execute immediately):
I will generate all seven MOECRAFT master documents, with titles:

01 MOECRAFT – Multi-LLM Orchestration PRD v1.0.0
02 MOECRAFT – Agentic Architecture & Routing Layer v1.0.0
03 MOECRAFT – Execution Environment & Tech Stack v1.0.0
04 MOECRAFT – Cross-Model Mapping & Capability Matrix v1.0.0
05 MOECRAFT – Architecture Gap Analysis & Remediation Plan v1.0.0
06 MOECRAFT – System Component Index v1.0.0
07 MOECRAFT – Meta-Genesis Prompt (Full Project Generator) v1.0.0

All written at enterprise-grade depth, full structure, proper meta-headers, and saved to Canvas immediately.
