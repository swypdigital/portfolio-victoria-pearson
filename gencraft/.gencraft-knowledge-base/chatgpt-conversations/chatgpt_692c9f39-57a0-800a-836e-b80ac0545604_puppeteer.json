      "content": "ChatGPT said:Below is the fastest and most reliable way to locate (or regenerate cleanly) the seven MOECRAFT pillar documents 01–07, even if the original canvas thread is lost or buried.\n\n✅ SUMMARY\nYou likely never received the complete, canvas-saved versions of the 01–07 MOECRAFT core documents, because our previous thread shows\n\n\nmultiple partial generations\n\n\nrestarts\n\n\ninterruptions\n\n\nand no final canvas write event for the whole set.\n\n\nTo fix this immediately, I can regenerate all seven documents, numbered properly, using your required enterprise structure (meta-header, versioning, rights statements, etc.) and save them directly into your canvas.\nBut first I need one clarification.\n\n❓ CLARIFYING QUESTION (Required for Fidelity)\nWhen we generated these last time, you instructed:\n\n“01 VibeCraft … continue … continue … continue … I thought we agreed to only generate 7 docs with the last being the genesis prompt …”\n\nYou now need MOECRAFT’s seven documents.\nWhich of these two interpretations is correct?\nOption A — MOECRAFT uses the SAME format as AAE/VibeCraft\nMeaning the seven docs are:\n01 PRD / Project Specification\n02 System Architecture\n03 Tech Stack\n04 Cross-Mapping Document\n05 Gap Analysis\n06 System Index\n07 Genesis Prompt (that generates all MOECRAFT artifacts)\nOption B — MOECRAFT uses a DIFFERENT 01–07 definition\nMeaning you want the exact seven items we originally outlined for MOECRAFT specifically — not the generalized 7-doc framework.\nIf your memory is that MOECRAFT had a different set of seven documents, I can reconstruct them from context and rebuild them.\n\n⚡ WHAT I CAN DO IMMEDIATELY\nAs soon as you pick A or B, I will:\n1. Recreate all seven documents from scratch (01–07)\nFull fidelity\nFull detail (implementation-grade)\nCorrect branding:\nVictoria Pearson – Meta AI Systems Architect™\ngroklyGroup LLC™ — All Rights Reserved\n2. Save each one directly to Canvas\nOne file per document, numbered exactly as required.\n3. Ensure they cross-link and share the same semantic version\ne.g., MOECRAFT Core Pillars 01–07 v1.0.0\n4. Restore MOECRAFT as a “pillar of the engine”\nso all downstream architecture references work again (skills.md, agent orchestration, ingestion, system vault, etc.).\n\n⚠️ OPTIONAL (If you want)\nI can also generate:\n“MOECRAFT Master Ledger”\nOne extra file that tracks:\n\n\nall MOECRAFT artifacts\n\n\ncurrent versions\n\n\ndependencies between documents\n\n\nwhere each asset is stored in Canvas\n\n\nSo you never lose track again.\n\n👉 Which version of the 7 documents should I generate? Option A or Option B?",

      "content": "ChatGPT said:✅ Recommendation: OPTION 2 — Specialized Titles (MOECRAFT-specific)\nBelow is the expert recommendation based on your ecosystem design and the role MOECRAFT plays as a pillar orchestration layer inside the larger GenCraft / MaverickStack architecture.\n\n⭐ WHY OPTION 2 IS SUPERIOR\n1. Greater precision for an orchestration engine\nMOECRAFT is not a generic project.\nIt is the multi-LLM orchestration system that coordinates:\n\n\nClaude Code\n\n\nGPT\n\n\nGemini\n\n\nLocal/Ollama\n\n\nTools, skills, planners, verifiers\n\n\nExecution sandboxes\n\n\nProject ingestion\n\n\nRouting logic\n\n\nToken efficiency layers\n\n\nGeneric labels (PRD, Architecture, Tech Stack, etc.) do not communicate that.\nSpecialized titles do.\n\n2. Cross-system clarity\nYour system includes:\n\n\nAAE\n\n\nVibeCraft\n\n\nEduCraft\n\n\nFinCraft\n\n\nLegalCraft\n\n\nGovCraft\n\n\nRiskCraft\n(and more)\n\n\nEach has a unique function.\nMOECRAFT’s documents must stand apart for:\n\n\nagent orchestration\n\n\nrouting\n\n\nmodel selection logic\n\n\ncapability conversion\n\n\ninternal tool/skill management\n\n\nSpecialized names prevent confusion when referenced by other pillars.\n\n3. Stronger downstream automation\nYour Genesis Prompt (Document 07) is meant to:\n\n\ngenerate the entire project\n\n\ngenerate all sub-documents\n\n\nreference them by title\n\n\nauto-propagate version numbers\n\n\nSpecialized titles ensure the genesis engine generates artifacts with clear, non-generic roles.\n\n4. Enterprise-grade documentation alignment\nYour ecosystem requires:\n\n\nstrict implementation-grade detail\n\n\ndependency mapping\n\n\ninternal linking\n\n\nversion alignment\n\n\nreproducible engineering outputs\n\n\nclarity in architecture audits\n\n\nSpecialized names support this better than generic ones.\n\n⭐ Conclusion\nOPTION 2 is the correct choice for a pillar-level orchestration framework.\nThis ensures maximum clarity, power, and future-proofing across the ecosystem.\n\n🚀 Next Step (I will execute immediately):\nI will generate all seven MOECRAFT master documents, with titles:\n\n01 MOECRAFT – Multi-LLM Orchestration PRD v1.0.0\n02 MOECRAFT – Agentic Architecture & Routing Layer v1.0.0\n03 MOECRAFT – Execution Environment & Tech Stack v1.0.0\n04 MOECRAFT – Cross-Model Mapping & Capability Matrix v1.0.0\n05 MOECRAFT – Architecture Gap Analysis & Remediation Plan v1.0.0\n06 MOECRAFT – System Component Index v1.0.0\n07 MOECRAFT – Meta-Genesis Prompt (Full Project Generator) v1.0.0\n\nAll written at enterprise-grade depth, full structure, proper meta-headers, and saved to Canvas immediately.\n\n❓ Confirm:\nShall I begin generating Document 01 now?",
