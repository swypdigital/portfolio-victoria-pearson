      "content": "You said:WHAT IF THE USER WANTS TO CREATE N8N AUTOMATIONS. COULD WE USE THE SYSTEM TO GENERATE THE ENTIRE N8N WORKFLOW? FOR EXAMPLE: I WANT TO AUTOMATE AN IDEA SCRAPER, A CONTENT CREATOR THAT CREATES THE SCRIPTS AND THE TALKING AI AVATAR VIDEO, AND THE AUTO  PUBLISHER TO PUBLISH ACROSS MULTIPLE SM PLATFORMS.\r\nTHIS VIDEO EXPLAINS WHAT I AM TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. HERE IS THE SCRIPT, LETS DISCUSS\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/bLu9ncvXgvQ?si=h5L_uuUtiRDwNvYB\r\nThis might be the most powerful AI automation I've ever built. It takes any viral X video like this one with millions of views and with one click, it creates the YouTube script, it takes the X video, creates a voice over with my voice, creates my AI avatar, and then combines everything together with music and the captions on top.\r\nBut even crazier, it autoposts the video to Tik Tok, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram every single day, getting me views while I do absolutely nothing. No filming, no talking into the microphone, no editing, just one click, boom, content. Pretty insane, right? And yes, this is me. It's not my AI clone.\r\nSo, if that's something that you want to set up, I'll show you three automations in this video. First one is the AI content creator. The second one is the automatic publisher, and the third one is the automatic idea scraper. So, it can run 24/7 without you actually even being there. But if you've never used NAM before, setting this up from scratch can be brutal.\r\nSo, that's why I try to make it as stupidly simple for you to set up. I'll give you the exact N template that you can import instantly. And I'll give you the air table where you can just duplicate it and you have everything that I have right here. But even though I'm giving you everything, pay very close attention because there are some mistake that can waste you hours and even cost you a lot of money.\r\nSo stay to the end of this video and I'll show you how to make it 100% fully automated by the end so you have your own content machine. Just follow this video step by step. Now let's start by watching some successful AI avatars. Take a look at this creator right here with around 400,000 followers getting around 100,000 291,000 views here using an AI avatar.\r\nAs you can see in the bottom, you might see that the lips are moving a little bit weird, but other than that, just listen to it. And all you have to do is describe your app idea. The AI. Yeah, that one got 6,000 likes. This one here as well. You don't need to pay for expensive API keys anymore. I just found a platform that gives you access to over 100,000 AI models.\r\nAs you can see, this is 100% AI generated where he doesn't have to be on camera. He doesn't have to voice over the video itself. The second creator is called Sky Generated and she also is a 100% AI generated content creator. Look at this one for example. Can literally make you million dollar anime episodes with consistent characters.\r\nThere you go. 3,000 likes. This one right here got around 300,000 views. So, here are seven animation styles you need to try in Sora 2 that look like $10,000 videos. Number one is retro90s cartoons. Pure nostalgia. Pretty insane, right? 16,000 likes. And it's not actually insane because the content is really good.\r\nAnd to show you another really great content creator is Rwan Chung. 190,000 followers. And as you can see, it's all the same AI avatar again and again with AI voice over as well that he doesn't produce himself. He has a team that makes it for him. Look at this. This just discovered a new type of superglue and it kept this rubber duck attached to a rock for over a year withstanding constant waves.\r\nDid you see that he was AI generated and that it doesn't matter that much? Take a look at this. This 7ft robot went from concept to working prototype in just 7 months. Humanoid, a Londonbased robotic startup, has unveiled their first finished product. I really love the way that it's an avatar first and then they're showing some really cool content.\r\nSo that's what the automation that I have created does as well. It allows you to make an avatar with just a single photo. So you don't have to be on camera. It automatically generates the script voice over and combines it all together with music. So you can automatically post on your social media. So, if you want to get started right now, I'll show you step by step how to set this up.\r\nEven if you've never done an Nan automation before, all I ask from you is that you like the video and comment down below AI avatar because it shows me that you're interested in this. Also, stay to the end so you can see me create five videos in 3 minutes and have them posted on social media automatically. So, let's get started with step number one, download the workflow.\r\nSo, all you need to do is to go inside of our school community, click on Vibe Creator 2.0, and go all the way down to Contentmate AI avatar X videos, and you will see download the N workflow and duplicate the Air Table base right here. Our school community is completely free for 7 days. And even if you don't grab it, keep watching cuz I'm going to explain everything right now.\r\nSo just click on download N workflow and click on download. Go inside of your own N and click on create workflow in the top. Then click on the three dots. Click on import from file and import the file that we just downloaded. So this should now be inside your N8N account. I recommend renaming it. Contentmate AI clone and then your name.\r\nSo, I'll do Andy for this one. If your N8N isn't looking exactly the same right now, I'll explain everything in just a second. But before that, step number two, duplicate the air table because the air table is where we control everything. As you can see, this is where we put a lot of X profiles.\r\nHere is where we scrape all the ideas. This is where we actually make the ideas with my AI avatar. And it of course looks like this. This is also where we store the avatars that I'll talk about in just a second. And we store the music here as well, where I'm giving you three of my favorite tracks that I created that you can use in your videos.\r\nAnd all you need to do to duplicate it is to go in the top, click on the down arrow right here, then click on the three dots right here, then on duplicate base. I highly recommend naming it your name once again. So I would do something like Andy, duplicate the records, duplicate the comments, and just click on duplicate base.\r\nAnd just like that, you have your own Air Table base that we're going to connect with this Nan workflow. So, if you're excited about setting it up, comment down below AI avatar and drop a like on this video. It really means a lot to me. So, now I'm going to show you exactly how we automatically trigger from an Xlink.\r\nIt makes a script. It makes a video with a AI voice over, an AI avatar. It combines it with music and it adds captions on top and it allows us to publish to Tik Tok, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. We can even connect to more platforms. But first, to make any of this work, we need to start with step number three.\r\nCreate the avatar. So, take a look at the avatars tab right here. This is loaded with six different avatars. And you can see here, this is not me. This is an AI avatar. And what we're going to do with this automation is that we're going to animate that they are speaking with their hands.\r\nAs you can see, we are going to do a lip sync on top after. So the mouth doesn't really have to move too much, but the hands and his body gesture should be looking like he's speaking or, you know, making content. Here is another one that look like this. And I think it looks absolutely perfect. I loaded myself in here as well.\r\nSo if you want to clone yourself, this is one of the photos of me and I pulled that through the exact same workflow. This was the output. And again, we're going to do lip sync later. So the mouth doesn't really need to be perfect here as well. I did this one for fun. Running it through this avatar video generator.\r\nAnd as you can see, this is how it looks like. And I think this could actually do pretty well on social media. But of course, I didn't forget about my girlies. So, this is a Norwegian woman with a nice sweater that I ran through the animator where she is speaking with her hands.\r\nAs you can see, this could be really good for social media. And the same goes with this girl as well, showing that you don't have to show your face. You don't have to make a video of yourself if you're not a personal brand like me for example, I'll use it with myself, but many of you may want to create your own AI avatar. And if you want me to show you how to do that, all you need to do is go to your favorite image generator of choice.\r\nI use crea.ai. And I'll click on the image generation button. Here, I'll select the aspect ratio of 9x6 and I'll describe the avatar that I want to generate. Once I'm happy with the prompt, I'll click on generate. And it looks all right, but not exactly what I want. So, I'll change the model and see how that works. She is a kid now woman.\r\nI'm going to add talking into the camera. Okay, it's getting better. This one looks pretty decent. So, what I'm going to do is download it, and then go inside of Contentmate, click on create a new record, and if you have duplicated your base, you can do this as well. Let's call this girl Victoria.\r\nAnd we'll just drag that file into the Air Table right here. As you can see, once you set up the automation, all you have to do is to click on this run button. It's going to run this automation right here. And as you can see, what it's doing is making the avatar speak with a video generator that moves her around.\r\nAnd pretty much all that happens is that we make her speak where we use that image as an input to a video generator. In this case, we're using a van video 2.2 I2V fast because the the price is just extremely cheap. As you can see, 11 cents for one avatar that we can use again and again. I'll keep you on top of the price as well if you're wondering what the price of everything is.\r\nNow, as you can see, Victoria has finished generating and the video comes back in our Air Table. And this is how it looks like. Perfect for social media, if I can say so myself. And just know that her lips will be animated again, uh, speaking the words of the script. So, now that we have one avatar, we can obviously create more. It's very easy.\r\nAnd I also encourage you to try to put some images of yourself in there as well. Some of them are good, some of them are pretty bad. I tried some funny ones, and I think it's pretty hilarious. It does look pretty good though, or real. I'll never be as beautiful as an AI avatar. Comment down below. AI avatars should be nerfed.\r\nThey don't deserve to be this pretty, and they don't even exist. Meanwhile, look at this ugly ass. Damn. I ain't got nothing on these AI avatars, man. So, now that you have an avatar animated, what you need is to find a voice that you want her to speak. So, we need to find a voice ID. So, let's go to step number four. Get voice ID.\r\nJust go to 11labs.com because this is the best AI voiceover platform that we're going to use. Just click on sign up if you don't have an account or log in if you do. Now, once you're on the inside, you can see that we have a bunch of voices. So, this is where we can find a voice for our AI avatar.\r\nAnd since ours is a girl, let's filter in the top right. Click on gender female and apply filter. You see, we have all these different languages as well. Let's listen to Sally Ford. Hi. And I would be really happy if you used my voice. I think it reflects my personality. So, I hope you like it. Okay, maybe let's try Eve. I had never given much thought to how I would die, but dying in the place of someone I love doesn't seem like such a bad way to go.\r\nNah, maybe a little bit too sad. Okay, don't want sad. Let's listen to Sally again. Hi. I would be really happy if you used my voice. I think it reflects my You know what? Let's go with Sally. So, all we need to do is go to the right side and click the three buttons. Now, let's copy the voice ID.\r\nLet's go back into Contentmate again. And in the voice ID column, all we need to do is to paste the voice ID next to Victoria's name here, as you can see. And we do this because once we start generating the script and getting the video and everything like that, we are going to create the voice and we're going to do it in this step right here.\r\nSo stick with me. It's going to be very exciting when we get back the voice speaking the script. But you might be asking, \"Hey Andy, what is the cost? How much is this costing me?\" And that's a pretty fair question. So, I'm going to show you right now what we're going to use is the 11 Labs API. So, that this is the pricing page.\r\nAs you can see, we can for completely free use 10,000 credits per month. So, that is 10 minutes of highquality text to speech like multilingual v2 or 20 minutes of flash v2.5, which I think is an amazing voice over as well. Or 15 minutes of agent. We don't need this right now. So, you could be doing this for completely free if you're using less than 10 minutes of voice.\r\nBut if you want to do professional voice cloning, like I have cloned my voice, you need to go up to the creator plan. So, this is the plan that I am on. I have my own professional voice clone. And at $11 per month, I think it's very fair. Having high quality voice clone is pretty crazy. So, if you don't want to clone your own voice and you just want to do an AI avatar voice, you can continue going through with the free plan.\r\nIsn't that exciting? Can I get a hallelujah in the chat? It's time to get on the dance floor and have a party. But right now, we only have an avatar and we have a voiceover ID. How are we going to turn this into a full video? So, let's go to step number five. Find viral X video. Just go to X.com because this is where we're going to find inspiration for what our avatar can make content about.\r\nIf you don't know, X is one of the places where you can find a lot of viral videos from companies that are trying to promote their own AI software. For example, as you can see, this is Seed 3D. Somebody made a tool that creates a 3D object from a single image. And do you think that this guy would care if we took his video and shared his product to the world? No, of course not.\r\nHe would love for us to share this with the world. To me, it just has a little bit too little views. I like something over 100,000. Even over a million is going to be best. So, I'm going to go to OpenAI. And of course, the biggest companies, they have the biggest news. And this week, Chachi dropped Atlas, which is their own browser.\r\nSo, I think it would be amazing to turn this into a video that our AI avatar is speaking about. Now, all we have to do is go to the top, copy the link, go back to Contentmate, make a new record, and paste the link right in here. Now, if we click on this button, we generate an entire video with our AI avatar, and I want to show you how that works.\r\nSo, I've set this up to be the web hook test right now. I'll click on save. So, if I just run this automation from the top right here, you can see execute workflow. And I click on this button right now. You can see the workflow has started and it's running right now through making the YouTube script where it's going to search for a bunch of things online about the exact topic.\r\nThen it's going to message the model to create the actual Tik Tok script or Instagram real script. Next, we're going to get the Xv video. So, we're using an appy scraper to essentially just take the video and download it onto our own nan. Now, this is the perfect time to mention again that this is a self-hosted workflow. Meaning that if you're using nan cloud, you will not be able to use this node which is writing a file to disk and this node which is executing a command because we're working with videos.\r\nUsing self-hosted is just so much more cost effective because you're not uploading massive files to the internet across from one tool to another tool. It's all happening internally and we're using ffmpeg to cut and edit the videos together. I made this video on my second channel to show you exactly how to set up your own self-hosting using Hostinger installing ffmpeg in a very simple way.\r\nSo, in 10 minutes, you can have your own self-hosted. Check out this video right here. How I add free captions to every video in N and set it up yourself. If you love automating video, so now after we've gotten the video and downloaded it, we make this X handle. And what this X handle is is really just an image of Open AI where we're using their uh Twitter profile picture and we're taking the views of the video itself and putting it in the bottom here.\r\nAnd then obviously we're going to have a full video in the middle right here, but it's basically just an image. And how we're making that happen is we're using an API called render form. In the link in description, I'll give you access to the template. All you need to do is to click on this link right here and then as you can see you can get the exact same template if you just click on save to my templates.\r\nAgain, render form is completely free up to 50 images per month. So as you can see what happened is we basically got the entire video and we got the handle in this step right here. So now that we downloaded the video itself and we got the handle in the background, we're going to go to step number six, create the voice. So, I'm just going to run it from this step right here and show you everything that is going on.\r\nSo, here you can see that we're going to use 11 Labs with the voice ID. And that happened way too quick. Next, we're going to step number seven, create avatar. Just like I told you before, we have that avatar that goes for 4 seconds. And in this case, we're using the avatar that is me in the pillar. So, you can check it out here. It's this one.\r\nIt's not my favorite, but hopefully it does the job. And now we're using a lip sync that essentially lip syncs the voice with the actual avatar itself. Then we actually moved on to combining the videos with the music. So we basically combining the first 3 seconds of the avatar. And then after that it goes on to being without the avatar.\r\nAnd that's where we have X video, the handle and everything like that. And lastly, we're just going to add captions on top. I'll come back to you once all of that is finished. Now, what we got back is in the create tab. You can see it right here. Click on it and let's enjoy. Open AAI just dropped ChatGpt Atlas, a brand new AI web browser for Mac users.\r\nLaunched October 21st. All right, I think that's pretty good. Now, of course, I want to test it out with the avatar we created earlier in the video. So, I'm just going to run it again. So, all I need to do is click on this button, and it's going to run through with our AI avatar model, Victoria.\r\nAnd I'm just going to time-lapse this entire thing, I think. So, let's take a look at the result. As you can see, now it is Victoria. Click on that. Open AAI just launched chat GPT atlas. A the text is right over her mouth. So what I can do is I can reduce the size of the top here by just cropping it a little bit.\r\nSo that happens right here. As you can see, crop the top. Let's do 150. Execute this step and then just run it again and it should all be fixed. Open AAI just launched chat GPT atlas. Wow, that is really good. It looks like she's super excited to share about it. Let's look at it again. And OpenAI just launched ChatGpt Atlas, a brand new AI web browser.\r\nIt debuted today on Mac OS and Bakes Chat GPT right inside every page. Really good. And so I actually really like this one and I want to post it on my account. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make the status schedule. And what happens then is that we're going to activate this publish automation right here. But you might be wondering what does that mean? Well, that's why we have to go to step number eight, automatic publishing.\r\nSo, as you can see, this is the automation that runs on a schedule. I have set it so that it schedules every 3 hours. So essentially what it does is it looks for if they are scheduled and every 3 hours if there is any it's going to schedule them out and run this entire automation here.\r\nAnd what it does in a nutshell is it creates all these captions for Tik Tok, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram. And then we use this service called Blotato to upload it to Tik Tok, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram. And we end it by updating the air table saying that it goes from the scheduled to published. All in all, a pretty simple automation that works excellently.\r\nSo, let me show you exactly how it works. If I'm going to run it right now, I can just click on execute workflow and really quickly it's going to message chatbt here. Then it's going to upload the video to blow and it's going to run through all of them really quickly. You'll see this right about now.\r\n1 2 3 4 and then we update it back here. And what's so cool is that now I can go to my Instagram. I can check my reels here in just a second. You can go to my Tik Tok and as you can see it's now on Tik Tok open Instagram is now posted and here as well we actually got another video over a,000 views 46 likes that I posted one day ago is completely generated as you can see 3,000 views right there.\r\nWe also uploaded to Facebook as you can see it's not a big platform of mine but yeah some of them are getting 100 uh views. It's easy to post here, so why not? As you can see, it worked really well on YouTube as well when I was testing it a lot. 71 new subscribers on a pretty new YouTube channel, but that was posting just one video.\r\nAnd since you saw how easy it was to create one of those videos, I want to talk to you more about how it can become more automatic. So, let's jump to step number nine, automatic scraping. So, this is one of my favorite automations. What it does is that every single day in the morning, it goes and scrapes every single X account for every single video that was posted.\r\nAnd instead of telling you what it does, I'm just going to show you. So, right now, if I just click on the execute workflow, which happens every single morning, you can see that it found 33x handles. We then use Appify to scrape all the different videos from all these creators that is public on X search.\r\nAnd once we found a great video that has been posted for the last 3 days, we actually create a record. As you can see, we just created a record. So, if I go to ideas, you can see M Flow Nio has posted something cool the last couple of days. As you can see, more and more sources are going through. I'm just going to let this run in the background.\r\nThink about this happening every single day. I'm going to make this into a time lapse. All right, that was all of them. As you can see, there was a lot of views. Um, I was very interested to see Clippy is back with Satya Nadella posting. So, let's check this one out. Whoa. Clippy. Clippy is back. Let's go. We We have been We have been asking for this.\r\nThat's so sick. So, that could easily be a video. It also got 900 almost a million views. And so, how we turn this more automatic is we have a filter in the top. As you can see, this is selected more wide. You can see that almost all of these videos are fit to be created and some of them have been created as well.\r\nSo what happens every single morning is that every day at 8 a.m. it actually automatically creates any of these that have this filter um in selected more wide and it also has no type. So this is actually the filter that we're filtering through. And so basically after 9:00 a.m. where I know that everything has been finished and I ran through it multiple times, I can just check out the create tab and I can see that there has been more videos created.\r\nAnd then all I need to do is I just have to turn it from review to schedule and it goes out. And all I got to do as well is just look at this video here. See is it good enough and I think this one isn't good enough. Google's AI Studio built a Windows simulator in 89 seconds. Yeah, I don't really like this one. So, it is still in review, but that's where I am the human making decisions together with AI.\r\nSo, I'm currently trying to make my AI avatar work on Instagram, Tik Tok, and some other accounts. And I just think it's so funny because content creation has been so hard for so long, but now it's starting to get easier. And I still love making videos. So, it's not like I'm just going to hand over this to AI, but it's nice that it can make at least a little bit and then I can make real content mixed together with AI content, making it a little bit easier for me.\r\nIt's not every day I want to step on the camera or talk into the microphone. So, it's nice to be able to make a video so I can share that with my audience and people that I like and care about. And if you're thinking about making your own AI avatar, I highly recommend go inside of AI mate in the link in description.\r\nGo and download the N workflow and duplicate the air table. There is a more stepbystep setup type video here. I know that this video that I made today was more like overview. So this is the click byclick stepbystep setup if you want to set it up from scratch. Let's make some AI avatar videos together. Thank you so much for watching the video and I'll see you in the next one. and paste.",

Supabase “Schemas & Tables” Templates\nYou can instantly scaffold common table types, e.g.:\n\n\n“Content”\n\n\n“Posts”\n\n\n“Tasks”\n\n\n“Jobs”\n\n\n“Metadata”\n\n\n“Media”\n\n\n“Events”\n\n\nWe will base your IDEA TABLE on the “content” and “task” schemas.\n\n**2. Supabase Edge Functions Templates\nThese are critical for:\n\n\nWebhook triggers\n\n\nPre-processing\n\n\nValidation\n\n\nInternal API calls\n\n\nTriggering n8n workflows\n\n\nWe can auto-generate:\n\n\nThumbnail generation endpoints\n\n\nLLM enrichment endpoints\n\n\nVideo creation triggers\n\n\n\n**3. Supabase Storage Templates\nBuilt-in templates allow you to organize:\n\n\nThumbnails\n\n\nRaw videos\n\n\nAudio\n\n\nAvatar assets\n\n\nCaptions\n\n\nLogs\n\n\nThis replaces building your own file storage.\n\n**4. Supabase Realtime Templates\nYou can subscribe to:\n\n\nINSERT INTO ideas\n\n\nUPDATE ideas SET status='ready'\n\n\nWhich allows n8n to trigger instantly when:\n\n\nYou add something to Google Sheets\n\n\nA scraper adds something\n\n\nMetadata enrichment completes\n\n\n\n**5. Supabase Auth Templates\nUseful if you will offer:\n\n\nMulti-user workflows\n\n\nTeams\n\n\nRoles\n\n\nEven if it’s just you, Supabase handles permissions securely.\n\n🟩 How We Use Supabase Templates in Your Final Architecture\nWe use:\n\n\n“Content” template → for ideas schema\n\n\n“Tasks/Job Queue” template → for workflow status states\n\n\n“Media storage” template → for thumbnails, videos, audio\n\n\n“Metadata” template → for enriched fields\n\n\n“Triggers” template → to notify n8n\n\n\n“Cron task” template → to auto-run scrapers\n\n\n“Row-level security” template → to isolate user data (if multi-user)\n\n\nWe DO NOT use:\n\n\nAny blog/CMS/UI template\n\n\nAny AI/video generator template (because they don’t exist)\n\n\n\n🟦 Recommended Supabase Template Setup for Your System\nHere’s the template combination I recommend:\n1. Content Template (Base Structure) → IDEA TABLE\nAdd:\n\n\nsource\n\n\ninput_text\n\n\nmetadata_json\n\n\nthumbnail_urls\n\n\nrequested_length\n\n\nstatus\n\n\n(LLM fields auto-generated)\n\n\n2. Storage Template → “media” and “thumbnails” buckets\nTo store:\n\n\nAvatar image\n\n\nThumbnail outputs\n\n\nFinal videos\n\n\nWhisper transcripts\n\n\nMusic clips\n\n\n3. Jobs/Tasks Template → Status Engine\nStatuses:\n\n\nnew\n\n\nscraped\n\n\nenriched\n\n\nready\n\n\nin_queue\n\n\nrendering\n\n\ncomplete\n\n\npublished\n\n\nrejected\n\n\n4. Realtime Template → Trigger n8n\nAny INSERT or UPDATE fires:\n\n\nn8n → enrich idea\n\n\nn8n → create script\n\n\nn8n → create video\n\n\nn8n → publish\n\n\n5. Edge Function Template → Webhook integration\nWe create:\n\n\n/enrich-idea\n\n\n/create-thumbnail\n\n\n/trigger-video\n\n\n\n🟧 What This Means for You\nYou do not need to hand-build a database from scratch.\nSupabase gives us 90% of the foundation, and we architect the 10% unique to your content engine.\nWith this approach:\n✔ Your Google Sheet is minimal (you can paste ANYTHING)\n✔ Supabase enriches your data\n✔ n8n receives real-time triggers\n✔ Metadata & thumbnails are generated automatically\n✔ Your final videos are produced automatically\n✔ Your content is published automatically\n\n🟪 CLARIFYING QUESTION (NEEDED BEFORE I BUILD YOUR SYSTEM)\nWhich Supabase setup do you prefer:\nA — Recommended (Content Template + Task Template + Storage Template)\nFully structured, best for scale.\nB — Minimal (One table: ideas + Storage)\nSimplest possible.\nC — Full Enterprise Setup (Content + Tasks + Workflow Logs + Media Buckets + Audit Logs)\nMost powerful, scalable, professional.\n\nReply A, B, or C, and I will generate the exact Supabase schema, n8n workflows, and Google Sheet format for your automation system.",

Firebase + Firestore (Google)\nSupabase was originally built as an “open Firebase alternative,” so this is its biggest commercial competitor.\nPros\n\n\nBattle-tested at scale\n\n\nExcellent SDKs\n\n\nAuthentication\n\n\nCloud functions\n\n\nRealtime DB\n\n\nCons\n\n\nNo SQL\n\n\nVendor lock-in\n\n\nExpensive at scale\n\n\nDifficult to migrate away\n\n\nNot self-hostable\n\n\nBest for\nMobile apps, chat apps, realtime dashboards.\n\n🟦 3. PocketBase (Lightweight, local, blazing fast)\nIf you want local-first, fully self-hosted, low-cost, this is the best.\nPros\n\n\n1 executable file (zero configuration)\n\n\nBuilt-in SQLite\n\n\nBuilt-in auth\n\n\nBuilt-in realtime\n\n\nBuilt-in file storage\n\n\nREST + realtime WebSocket API\n\n\nCons\n\n\nNot Postgres\n\n\nNo vector support\n\n\nLess enterprise-ready than Supabase\n\n\nBest for\nLocal automation engines, offline-first apps, personal tools.\nFor your n8n system, PocketBase is actually a GREAT match if you prioritize local control.\n\n🟦 4. NHost (Hasura-based, Postgres, Auth, Storage)\nClosest competitor in terms of:\n\n\nAuth\n\n\nPostgres\n\n\nStorage\n\n\nFunctions\n\n\nGraphQL-first\n\n\nPros\n\n\nBest-in-class GraphQL API\n\n\nHasura real-time queries\n\n\nServerless functions\n\n\nGood developer experience\n\n\nCons\n\n\nNot fully open-source\n\n\nNo vector database support compared to Supabase’s pgvector\n\n\nMore expensive\n\n\nBest for\nGraphQL-heavy applications or teams already using Hasura.\n\n🟦 5. Convex (Newer, high-performance real-time backend)\nA modern backend optimized for:\n\n\nRealtime\n\n\nTransactions\n\n\nServerless functions\n\n\nTypeScript everywhere\n\n\nPros\n\n\nBlazing fast\n\n\nStrong reactive queries\n\n\nAmazing DX\n\n\nGreat for complex stateful applications\n\n\nCons\n\n\nNot Postgres\n\n\nProprietary\n\n\nNo self-hosting (currently)\n\n\nBest for\nInteractive dashboards, collaborative apps, live systems.\n\n🟧 FOR ENTERPRISE OR HEAVY AI PROJECTS\nThese are less “Supabase clones” and more architectural alternatives depending on the database layer you want.\n\n🟩 6. Neon (Serverless Postgres)\nNeon = “serverless Postgres + branching.”\nMany teams use Neon + custom backend instead of Supabase.\nPros\n\n\nServerless\n\n\nAuto-scaling\n\n\nBranching\n\n\nGreat developer UX\n\n\nCons\n\n\nNo auth\n\n\nNo storage\n\n\nNo functions\n\n\nNot a full Supabase replacement\n\n\n\n🟩 7. PlanetScale (Serverless MySQL)\nA superb DB but not a full platform.\nGreat as a database alternative.\nNot a Supabase platform alternative.\n\n🟩 8. Xata (Serverless Database + Search + Vectors)\nPostgres + Elasticsearch vibes.\nPros\n\n\nGood for AI apps\n\n\nAutomatic vector indexing\n\n\nSearch indexing built-in\n\n\nCons\n\n\nProprietary\n\n\nNot self-hostable\n\n\nNo realtime\n\n\nNo edge functions\n\n\nNo storage\n\n\n\n🟩 9. Directus (Data CMS + API Layer)\nThink of it as a headless CMS for any SQL database.\nPros\n\n\nNo-code API generation\n\n\nAdmin UI\n\n\nHeadless content management\n\n\nCons\n\n\nNo built-in auth like Supabase\n\n\nNo storage\n\n\nNo serverless functions\n\n\nNot a Postgres host\n\n\n\n🟩 10. Hasura (GraphQL API for Postgres)\nOften paired with Supabase or NHost.\nNot a full backend platform.\n\n🟦 THE REALITY FOR YOUR PROJECT\nBased on what you’re building:\n\n\nIdea scraping\n\n\nMetadata enrichment\n\n\nVideo generation\n\n\nPublishing pipelines\n\n\nGoogle Sheets integration\n\n\nLocal LLM model chaining\n\n\nStoring thumbnails/video/audio\n\n\nRunning n8n locally\n\n\nThe only competitors that truly make sense are:\n1. Supabase\n(best overall blend of storage, auth, Postgres, and functions)\n2. PocketBase\n(best for local, lightweight, offline-first automation)\n3. NHost\n(best if you prefer GraphQL and Hasura)\n4. Appwrite\n(best fully open-source alternative to Supabase)\nEverything else (Firebase, PlanetScale, Neon, Xata) is only a partial replacement.\n\n🟧 RECOMMENDATION FOR YOUR SYSTEM\nGiven your goals:\n\n\nLocal n8n\n\n\nFree-first design\n\n\nStorage-heavy (video + thumbnails)\n\n\nReal-time workflow triggers\n\n\nLLM metadata generation\n\n\nScalable idea scraping\n\n\nSupabase remains the #1 fit.\nThe only viable alternative would be:\nPocketBase\nif you want maximum speed, lowest overhead, and pure local self-hosting.\n\n🟪 NEXT QUESTION\nDo you want me to generate:\nA) The same architecture using Supabase\nOR\nB) The same architecture using PocketBase\nOR\nC) A comparison showing which one fits your goals best?\nYour answer determines which database schema + workflow set I generate next.",

Add Captions (Auto-Captions)\nHe uses an API that adds:\n\n\nWord-level timing\n\n\nYellow/white social captions\n\n\nThis can be replaced with:\n\n\nWhisper → SRT\n\n\nFFmpeg subtitle overlay\n\n\n\n13. Save Final Video to Airtable\nStores:\n\n\nFinal MP4 URL\n\n\nThumbnail\n\n\nScript\n\n\nMetadata\n\n\nStatus becomes:\n\n\nreview\n\n\n\n14.

Zero setup\nYou don’t create tables, migrations, indexes.\nYou just add a column. Done.\n2. Spreadsheet-style UI\n\n\nFilter views\n\n\nKanban\n\n\nGrid\n\n\nForm view\n\n\nCalendar\n\n\nGallery view\n\n\nYou cannot match this UI in Supabase without building a frontend.\n3. Perfect for manual review steps\nE.g.:\n\n\nApprove script\n\n\nApprove thumbnail\n\n\nSelect avatar\n\n\nSchedule for publishing\n\n\nQA final result\n\n\nAirtable is BUILT for teams doing creative workflows.\n4. One-click triggers inside the UI\nYou saw in the video:\n\n\n“Run automation”\n\n\n“Schedule”\n\n\n“Review”\n\n\nSupabase has none of that.\n5. Extremely easy n8n integration\nAirtable → n8n is basically plug & play.\nSupabase → n8n requires:\n\n\nAPI keys\n\n\nSQL queries\n\n\nEndpoints\n\n\nDesigning schemas\n\n\n6. Perfect for Version 1\nIf you want to build this FAST, then Airtable is the fastest path.\n\n🟥 WHEN SUPABASE IS BETTER\nIf you EVER care about:\n\n\nscaling\n\n\ncosts\n\n\nconcurrency\n\n\ncustom logic\n\n\nenterprise automation\n\n\nmulti-user SaaS\n\n\nmore than 5,000 records\n\n\nAI pipelines that store embeddings\n\n\ncomplex relational schema\n\n\nhigh-volume video production\n\n\nlarge file storage\n\n\nhigh automation throughput\n\n\nbuilding an API-based system\n\n\nfuture productizing your automation\n\n\nThen Airtable becomes a hard bottleneck.\nHere’s why:\n\n🔥 Supabase Advantages (That Airtable Cannot Match)\n1. Unlimited scale\nAirtable freezes up with:\n\n\n~50,000 records\n\n\nlarge attachments\n\n\nheavy automation loads\n\n\nSupabase handles millions of rows easily.\n\n2. SQL + TypeScript + Edge Functions\nYou get:\n\n\nSQL triggers\n\n\nStored procedures\n\n\nAPI endpoints\n\n\nInstant docs\n\n\nServerless logic at the DB layer\n\n\nVector embeddings\n\n\nAirtable cannot do any of this.\n\n3. Real file storage (huge)\nSupabase can store:\n\n\nVideos\n\n\nAudio\n\n\nRaw downloads\n\n\nThumbnails\n\n\nCaptions\n\n\nAvatars\n\n\nGenerated files\n\n\nAirtable has tiny storage limits and becomes slow with attachments.\n\n4. Vector Search (pgvector) for AI\nSupabase supports embeddings:\n\n\nIdea similarity\n\n\nTopic clustering\n\n\n“Suggest script style”\n\n\n\"Find similar videos\"\n\n\n“Recommend thumbnail styles”\n\n\nAirtable can't do vector search.\n\n5. Real-time triggers (webhooks)\nSupabase:\n\n\nTriggers when a row updates\n\n\nPushes events to n8n\n\n\nNo polling\n\n\nNo delays\n\n\nAirtable:\n\n\nPolling every 1–5 minutes\n\n\nCan hit automation limits\n\n\n\n6. Extremely low cost\nAirtable pricing scales VERY poorly.\nSupabase:\n\n\n$25/mo → huge capacity\n\n\n$0.25/GB storage\n\n\n$0.02 per million row inserts\n\n\nAt scale, Supabase is ~10x cheaper.\n\n7. Perfect for SaaS products\nIf you ever turn this into a commercial tool, Supabase is the backend you want.\nAirtable is not appropriate for SaaS platforms unless you're building a tiny MVP.\n\n🟧 THE REALITY FOR YOUR SPECIFIC PROJECT\nLet’s apply this to YOUR AI video generator + idea scraper + publishing engine:\nWhy Airtable works perfectly (V1)\n\n\nStore ideas\n\n\nStore avatars\n\n\nStore scripts\n\n\nStore generated videos\n\n\nView the pipeline visually\n\n\nAdd a “Schedule” button\n\n\nScrape ideas and list them\n\n\nManual review step\n\n\nWorks exactly like the video\n\n\nWhy Supabase becomes essential (V2–V3)\n\n\nYou want thousands of ideas\n\n\nYou want fast inserts\n\n\nYou want 75–500 videos/day\n\n\nYou want AI embeddings + vector search\n\n\nYou want content recommendations\n\n\nYou want multi-user system\n\n\nYou want to automate EVERYTHING\n\n\nYou want to eventually build this into a SaaS under groklyGroup LLC™\n\n\nSupabase supports enterprise growth.\nAirtable does not.\n\n🟩 WHAT I RECOMMEND FOR YOU (BASED ON EVERYTHING YOU’RE BUILDING)\nOption C: Airtable now → Supabase later\nThis is BY FAR the best path.\nWhy start with Airtable?\n\n\nInstant UI\n\n\nEasy to validate workflows\n\n\nPerfect for prototyping\n\n\nPerfect for reviewing ideas\n\n\nPerfect for manual quality control\n\n\nMatches the video you’re copying\n\n\nFastest way to test your pipeline\n\n\nWhy migrate to Supabase later?\n\n\nUnlimited scale\n\n\nBetter cost\n\n\nFile storage for videos\n\n\nSQL-based automation\n\n\nVector embeddings\n\n\nMulti-user backend for your future SaaS\n\n\nProfessional infrastructure\n\n\nEnterprise-grade reliability\n\n\nPerfect alignment with your groklyGroup LLC™ architecture\n\n\n\n🎯 FINAL ANSWER\nYou build in Airtable first because it gives you the speed and visual workflow you saw in the video.\nYou move to Supabase later because it gives you the scale, cost benefits, and enterprise-level features needed to turn this into a massive automated content system or SaaS product.\nThis is the correct architectural path for your goal.\n\n❓ LAST QUESTION BEFORE I GENERATE EVERYTHING\nChoose one:\nA) Start in Airtable → Later migrate to Supabase (recommended)\nB) Build directly in Supabase (more work, more power)\nC) Build in Airtable only (simplest)\nWhich option do you pick?",

Yes.\nConceptually, nothing changes except one branch of the Content Creator workflow:\nShared parts (video + static)\nAll of this is identical whether the output is a video or an image:\n\n\nIdea capture (scraped + manual, from Airtable/Sheets)\n\n\nIdea enrichment (title, hook, summary, keywords, hashtags, suggested length, topic)\n\n\nPlatform mapping (which platforms should get content from this idea)\n\n\nCaption / copy generation\n\n\nTracking, statuses, analytics structure\n\n\nWhere they diverge\nIn n8n Content Creator, you add a simple branch based on Content Type:\n\n\nIf Content Type = Video → run the video pipeline\n\n\nIf Content Type = Static Image → run the image pipeline\n\n\nIf Content Type = Both → run both branches\n\n\n\n3. Static Image Pipeline (inside the same system)\nFor static posts, the flow looks like this:\n\n\nPick an Idea\n\n\nFrom Airtable where Content Type includes Static Image and Status = Enriched.\n\n\n\n\nGenerate captions / copy\n\n\nUse the same LLM, but ask for:\n\n\nShort caption for IG/TikTok stills\n\n\nSlightly longer caption for LinkedIn/FB\n\n\nOptional alt-text or image description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate the static image\n\n\nUse either:\n\n\nLocal Stable Diffusion / Flux\n\n\nOr an external API (DALL·E, Midjourney via proxy, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nPrompt is built from:\n\n\nHook + summary\n\n\nBrand/style hints (colors, tone, “clean infographic”, “bold quote card”, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nOutput: 1–4 candidate PNG/JPGs.\n\n\n\n\nSave image & link it to the idea\n\n\nImage files go into Media Assets / Thumbnails in Airtable.\n\n\nMark one as Selected = Yes.\n\n\n\n\nCreate Final Posts for each platform\n\n\nFor image-capable posts: IG feed, LinkedIn, X, Pinterest, FB, etc.\n\n\nAttach:\n\n\nSelected image\n\n\nCaption\n\n\nTarget platform\n\n\nStatus = Draft or Ready.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuto Publisher does the rest\n\n\nSame Auto Publisher workflow can:\n\n\nUpload images instead of videos\n\n\nUse the caption field from Final Posts\n\n\nMark Status = Published once successful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo: same idea table, same metadata, same publisher; only the “content creation” node swaps video assembly for image generation.\n\n4. Practical implication for you\n\n\nYou DO NOT need a separate “static image system.”\n\n\nThe Project Scope already includes static images as a first-class content type.\n\n\nThe Beginner Walkthrough explicitly explains that video and static-image content share the same pipeline and tables; only the branch in n8n differs.\n\n\nWhen you’re ready, we can zoom into just the Static Image Content Creator workflow and I can spell out each node (in/out fields, prompts, and how to plug in your preferred image model).",
