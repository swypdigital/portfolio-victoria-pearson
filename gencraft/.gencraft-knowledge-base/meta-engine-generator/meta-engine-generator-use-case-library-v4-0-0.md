## Document Contract

### Binding Declaration

This document (**Meta Engine Generator: Use Case Library v4.0.0**) and its companion document (**Meta Engine Generator v4.0.0**) constitute a **single, unified system specification**. Neither document is complete without the other.

### Document Governance

| Document | Governs | Authority |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Meta Engine Generator v4.0.0** | Architecture, capabilities, core logic, guardrails, learning system | PRIMARY - defines what the system IS and HOW it operates |
| **Use Case Library v4.0.0** (this document) | Domain applications, examples, implementation patterns, commercial prioritization | REFERENCE - defines WHERE and FOR WHAT the system is applied |

### Version Coupling

These documents are **version-locked**:
- Changes to either document require synchronized updates to both
- A v4.x Use Case Library is only valid with a v4.x Meta Engine Generator
- Breaking changes increment the major version on BOTH documents simultaneously

### Cross-References

This document references and depends on:
- **Guardrails Framework** (defined in Meta Engine Generator v4.0.0)
- **Recursive Learning Architecture** (defined in Meta Engine Generator v4.0.0)
- **Core Processing Modes** (defined in Meta Engine Generator v4.0.0)
- **Engine Pattern Library** (defined in Meta Engine Generator v4.0.0)
- **Required Architecture Dependencies** (defined in Meta Engine Generator v4.0.0)
  - Hardened Enforcement Architecture (external dependency - search or generate)
  - Output Validation & Fact-Checking Framework (external dependency - search or generate)

|------|-------|--------|----------------------|
| **Forward** | Current state + Action | Predicted outcomes | "What will happen if..." |
| **Reverse** | Desired outcome | Required path (+ ideal starting state if context absent) | "How do I achieve..." |
| **Transform** | Source format | Target format | "Convert X to Y" |
| **Evaluation** | Items to assess | Scored rankings | "Rate/evaluate these" |

### Mode Selection Signals

| Mode | Trigger Signals |
|------|-----------------|
| **Forward** | "predict", "forecast", "if we", "consequences", "impact of", "what happens" |
| **Reverse** | "achieve", "path to", "needed for", "steps to", "how do I get to", "requirements" |

## Scope Configuration Templates

*Guardrails Framework and Auto-Generation defined in Universal Engine Generator v4.0.0*

### Auto-Generation Capability

**CRITICAL: These templates are EXAMPLES to illustrate the pattern.**

The Universal Engine Generator **auto-generates scope configurations** for ANY deployment context. There is NO limit to the domains, purposes, or use cases the system can support. 

When deployed for a new purpose, the system:
1. Analyzes the deployment context
2. Uses its own Reverse Mode to generate appropriate boundaries
3. Validates against universal ethical guardrails
4. Self-enforces during operation
5. Refines through learning

**The templates below show the PATTERN. The system generates configurations for domains not listed here.**

|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Manufacturing** | "If we change X, what defects?" | "We need 99.9% yield - what's required?" |
| **Sports** | "If we draft this player, what happens?" | "We want championship - what's the path?" |
| **Healthcare** | "If we apply treatment, what outcomes?" | "Patient needs recovery - what protocol?" |
| **Education** | "If we teach this way, what results?" | "Student needs X - what's the learning path?" |
| **Finance** | "If we invest here, what returns?" | "We need 20% ROI - what strategy?" |
| **Product** | "If we launch these features, what response?" | "We want PMF - what's needed?" |
| **Consulting** | "If client does X, what happens?" | "Client wants Y - what's required?" |
| **Games** | "If player takes action, what unfolds?" | "We want balance - what design?" |
| **HR/Interview** | "If we ask this question, what do we learn?" | "We want to assess X - what questions?" |
| **Content** | "If we post this, what engagement?" | "We want viral - what content?" |

### Pattern 2: Learning Path + Assessment

**Composition:** Reverse → Forward → Evaluation

```yaml
learning_path_with_assessment:
  scope_config: "AI Literacy" or "VibeCoder"
  
  engine_chain:
    1_reverse_path:
      mode: reverse
      input: target_competency
      output: learning_path_with_milestones
      learning: captures_path_mastery_patterns
      
    2_scenario_generator:
      mode: forward
      input: competency_requirements
      output: assessment_scenarios
      learning: captures_scenario_discrimination_patterns
      
    3_evaluator:
      mode: evaluation
      input: learner_responses
      output: competency_scores + gaps
      learning: captures_response_competency_correlation
```

### Pattern 3: Interview Preparation System

**Composition:** Reverse → Forward → Evaluation → Forward

```yaml
interview_prep_system:
  scope_config: "Interview"
  
  engine_chain:
    1_skill_gap_analysis:
      mode: reverse
      input: target_role + current_skills
      output: skill_gap_profile
      
    2_question_generator:
      mode: forward
      input: role + gaps + resume
      output: targeted_practice_questions
      
    3_response_evaluator:
      mode: evaluation
      input: practice_responses
      output: quality_scores + feedback
      
    4_improvement_predictor:
      mode: forward
      input: practice_history
      output: readiness_prediction + focus_areas
```

## Learning Integration Examples

### Example 1: Cross-Session User Learning

```yaml
scenario: "User has used ConsultCraft for 3 sessions"

session_1_learning:
  captured:
    - user_prefers_bullet_points_over_prose
    - user_operates_in_healthcare_consulting
    - user_modifies_outputs_to_add_more_quantification
    
session_2_application:
  applied:
    - default_to_bullet_point_format
    - prioritize_healthcare_examples
    - include_quantification_in_initial_output
  captured:
    - user_accepted_output_without_modification
    - user_asked_for_stakeholder_personas
    
session_3_application:
  applied:
    - all_prior_preferences
    - proactively_include_stakeholder_analysis
  result: output_quality_improved, modification_rate_decreased
```

---

### Example 2: Domain-Level Pattern Learning

```yaml
scenario: "1000 users have used Education scope engines"

pattern_extracted:
  observation: "Learning paths with spaced_repetition checkpoints have 40% higher mastery rates"
  
  integration:
    update: Education scope engines now default to spaced_repetition
    validation: A/B test shows improvement holds
    propagation: Pattern added to domain_knowledge_base
```

---

### Example 3: Meta-Recursive Improvement

```yaml
scenario: "System detects declining satisfaction scores in Interview scope"

meta_recursive_process:
  step_1:
    action: Generate "Interview Satisfaction Analyzer Engine"
    using: Universal Engine Generator
    
  step_2:
    action: Apply analyzer to all Interview scope generations
    finding: "Questions generated lack industry-specificity"
    
  step_3:
    action: Generate "Industry-Specific Question Generator Improver Engine"
    using: Universal Engine Generator
    
  step_4:
    action: Apply improver to Interview Question Generator
    result: Updated question generation with industry customization
    
  step_5:
    action: Monitor satisfaction scores
    result: Scores improve, change validated
```
