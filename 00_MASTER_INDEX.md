## 🎯 YOUR STORY

**Core Narrative:**
61-year-old African American woman, self-taught, no formal tech background. Learned AI in 12 months and built $8M-25M IP portfolio - for the love of creating.

**Universal Message:**
"In today's climate of layoffs and uncertainty, AI is destroying careers. But there's a window to learn AI and launch your next career. I did it at 61 with no tech background. You can too. The window is closing - but it's still open."

**Target Audiences:**
- 20-somethings: No clear career path forward
- 30-40s: Mortgage, kids, rug pulled out
- 50-60s: Written off by employers
- College grads: Degrees leading nowhere
- Everyone: The existential dread of AI replacement

**The Hope:** If I can do this, ANYONE can catch this window
