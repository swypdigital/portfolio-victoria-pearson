# LETTER OF INSTRUCTION TO VICTORIA AND MICHAEL PEARSON
## What To Do With Mom's Tech Portfolio - Complete Action Plan

**Date Created:** December 16, 2025
**From:** Victoria Pearson (Mom)
**To:** Victoria Pearson (31, eldest daughter) and Michael Pearson (27, son)
**Purpose:** Clear, actionable instructions for monetizing my $8M-25M IP portfolio if something happens to me

---

## 🎯 TO MY CHILDREN: READ THIS FIRST

Victoria and Michael,

If you're reading this, something has happened to me. I need you both to set aside grief for 72 hours and **act immediately** to secure what I've built. After that, grieve all you need. But the first 72 hours are critical.

**Victoria:** You're the Type-A leader. You'll drive this process. Your corporate experience and buttoned-up execution style are exactly what's needed here. This is a business transaction, not a technical project. You don't need to understand code—you need to manage professionals who do.

**Michael:** You're the artist with Prince-level creative genius. Your role is to think differently—see opportunities Victoria might miss, ask the "why not?" questions, and bring the unconventional thinking that makes deals happen. Your self-taught mastery of music proves you can learn anything—including enough tech business to be dangerous.

**Together, you're unstoppable.** Victoria's discipline + Michael's creativity = the perfect team to turn this portfolio into $8M-25M.

## 🎯 SECTION 2: YOUR STRENGTHS & ROLES (Why You Can Do This)

### **Victoria (Age 31, Type-A Corporate Leader):**

**Your Strengths:**
- **Executive presence:** You can walk into boardrooms and command respect
- **Project management:** You know how to drive complex projects to completion
- **Corporate navigation:** You understand how big companies make decisions
- **Risk assessment:** Your buttoned-up nature = thorough due diligence
- **Negotiation:** You've done this in your career—just apply it here

**What You DON'T Need:**
- You don't need to code (hire developers)
- You don't need to understand algorithms (hire CTOs)
- You don't need to be "technical" (you need to be strategic)

**Your Role:**
1. **Project Manager:** Drive the overall process, hold team accountable
2. **Business Strategist:** Decide quick sale vs. strategic monetization
3. **Negotiator:** Lead buyer discussions, close deals
4. **Quality Control:** Ensure nothing gets overlooked
5. **Decision Maker:** When Michael and advisors disagree, you make the call

**Example Tasks:**
- Interview and hire the IP attorney, tech consultant, broker
- Create project timeline with milestones
- Manage the "data room" for buyers (documents, code, financials)
- Lead pitch meetings with potential acquirers
- Negotiate deal terms

---

### **Michael (Age 27, Self-Taught Musical Genius):**

**Your Strengths:**
- **Creative thinking:** You see connections others miss (like I do)
- **Self-taught mastery:** You learned guitar by ear at 6, coding by necessity—you can learn tech business the same way
- **Pattern recognition:** Music is patterns—so is software architecture
- **Unconventional approach:** You'll ask "why not sell it to a music tech company?" when everyone else is stuck in the box
- **Artist's eye:** You spot bad UX/design instantly (like Santana spots a wrong note)

**What You DON'T Need:**
- You don't need corporate polish (Victoria has that)
- You don't need to "fit in" with tech bros (your outsider view is the advantage)
- You don't need formal training (you've proven self-teaching works)

**Your Role:**
1. **Creative Strategist:** Think beyond obvious buyers—who ELSE would want this?
2. **Product Tester:** Test user experience—if it's clunky, you'll feel it
3. **Story Crafter:** Help articulate the vision in ways artists/non-tech people understand
4. **Devil's Advocate:** When Victoria's ready to take a $2M offer, you ask "what if we wait for $5M?"
5. **Unconventional Connector:** You know artists, musicians, creatives—networks Victoria doesn't have

**Example Tasks:**
- Test GenCraft and BookCraft from artist's perspective—what would YOU use it for?
- Brainstorm creative marketing angles Victoria wouldn't think of
- Research music tech companies that might acquire GenCraft (AI-generated lyrics? Music bios?)
- Challenge assumptions: "Mom said sell to HireVue—but what about LinkedIn Learning? They need this."
- Keep Victoria from moving too fast or accepting lowball offers

---

### **Why You NEED Each Other:**

**Victoria alone:** Might get stuck in analysis paralysis, overthink, or accept a "safe" deal too quickly

**Michael alone:** Might chase creative ideas that aren't practical, miss business fundamentals, or be too idealistic on valuations

**Together:** Victoria's discipline + Michael's creativity = you'll see opportunities others miss AND execute on them

---

## 💰 SECTION 3: THE BIG DECISION - QUICK SALE VS. STRATEGIC

**Within 7 days of assembling your team, you must decide:**

### **OPTION A: QUICK SALE (60-90 days, $3M-8M total)**

**Best If:**
- You both have demanding careers and can't dedicate time
- You need liquidity immediately (estate taxes, etc.)
- You'd rather have $3M-5M cash now than potentially $15M-25M later
- You're risk-averse and want certainty

**Process:**
1. Hire tech consultant to audit code ($10K-20K)
2. Hire business broker ($50K-100K success fee, or 5-10% of sale)
3. Create "teaser" document (project summaries without code)
4. Reach out to top 30 buyers (contact list in Section 6)
5. Interested buyers sign NDA
6. Provide full data room (code, docs, financials)
7. Buyers make offers (expect 5-10 serious ones)
8. Negotiate, close in 60-90 days

**Expected Outcome:**
- InterviewPlus: $2M-3M
- BookCraft: $500K-800K
- GenCraft (no patent): $1M-2M
- Claude OS: $300K-500K (license, not sell)
- TokenCalc: $300K-500K
- LeadCraft: $200K-400K
- **TOTAL: $4M-7M after fees**

**Timeline:** 3-6 months to cash in hand

---

### **OPTION B: STRATEGIC MONETIZATION (12-24 months, $10M-25M+ potential)**

**Best If:**
- You can dedicate 10-20 hours/week (Victoria) + 5-10 hours/week (Michael) for 12-18 months
- You're comfortable with risk for higher reward
- You trust your ability to hire and manage developers
- You see this as career-defining opportunity

**Process:**
1. Prioritize projects by "quick win" potential (Section 8)
2. Complete the top 2-3 projects (hire developers: $100K-200K)
3. Launch with minimal marketing (get traction proof)
4. Get to $50K-100K MRR within 6-12 months
5. THEN sell—with revenue, valuations are 5-10x higher
6. Alternatively, keep Claude OS as consulting practice (passive income)

**Expected Outcome:**
- InterviewPlus: Launch, get 1,000 users, sell for $8M-15M
- BookCraft: Launch, get 500 authors, sell for $5M-10M
- GenCraft: FILE PATENT ($15K), sell IP for $10M-20M
- Claude OS: Consulting practice, $300K-500K/year (don't sell—passive income)
- TokenCalc: Launch free, get 10K users, sell for $2M-3M
- LeadCraft: Quick flip for $500K-1M
- **TOTAL: $15M-30M+ over 18-24 months**

**Timeline:** 18-24 months, but you're building generational wealth

---

### **My Recommendation (If You Want My Opinion):**

**HYBRID APPROACH:**

1. **Quick sale:** LeadCraft, TokenCalc (low effort, $500K-1M total) → Get immediate cash
2. **Strategic:** InterviewPlus, BookCraft (highest upside) → Invest cash from #1 into completing these
3. **Patent & hold:** GenCraft → File patent, then decide (could be $20M+)
4. **Operate:** Claude OS → Don't sell, run as consulting practice ($300K-500K/year passive)

**Outcome:** $2M-3M in 90 days (quick sales) + $10M-20M in 18 months (strategic) + $300K-500K/year ongoing (consulting) = **$12M-23M total + passive income**

**My honest opinion:** Victoria, you're buttoned-up and risk-averse—you'll want quick sale. Michael, you're an artist who sees potential—you'll want strategic. Force yourselves to meet in the middle with the hybrid approach. You'll thank me later.

**DO:**
- ✅ Use business broker for warm intros
- ✅ Send "teaser" document first (1-page overview, no code)
- ✅ Require NDA before detailed discussions
- ✅ Have IP attorney review ALL communications
- ✅ Create urgency: "We're talking to multiple buyers, decisions needed by [date]"

**Investment:** $5K-10K (developer time)
**Tasks:**
- Polish UI

- Launch on Product Hunt
**Expected Outcome:** 1K-10K users in 30 days, sell for $400K-1M

**Expected Outcome:** 100-500 paying authors, sell for $2M-5M

- Analytics dashboard
**Expected Outcome:** 500-1000 users, sell for $5M-10M

## 📞 SECTION 9: WEEKLY CHECK-IN PROTOCOL

**For 90 days after my passing, you two MUST have weekly calls:**

**Every Monday, 6pm:**
- **Victoria leads:** Review action items from last week
- **Michael reports:** Creative ideas, unconventional angles
- **Team updates:** Lawyer, broker, consultant report progress
- **Decision time:** Any major decisions needed?
- **Next week plan:** Who does what by when?

**Why This Matters:** You'll drift apart if you don't have structure. Monday calls = accountability.

## ❤️ SECTION 10: FINAL WORDS FROM MOM

Victoria and Michael,

I built this portfolio for the love of creating. But I'm leaving it to you because I love you more.

**Victoria:** Your Type-A excellence will make you want to "do it right." But perfect is the enemy of done. You don't need to understand every line of code—you need to trust the professionals you hire and make strategic decisions. Your corporate leadership skills are MORE valuable here than technical knowledge. Trust yourself.

**Michael:** Your artistic genius will make you see possibilities others miss. But don't let perfect creative ideas prevent good business decisions. Not every project needs to be "Prince-level"—some just need to sell for $2M so Victoria can quit overthinking. Your unconventional thinking is the secret weapon here.

**Together:** You're going to disagree. Victoria will want the safe $3M deal. Michael will want to hold out for $10M. When you're stuck, remember this:

- **If you can't agree in 30 days, do the quick sale.** Certainty > potential
- **If you both agree it's worth the risk, go strategic.** You're smarter than me
- **If one of you gets sick of it, sell immediately.** Mental health > money

This portfolio represents 12 months of my life. But it's not my legacy. **You two are my legacy.** The money doesn't matter—I won't be here to spend it. What matters is that you work together, trust each other, and don't let this tear you apart.

If you sell it all for $3M in 60 days and go back to your lives, I'll be proud.

If you turn it into $20M over 2 years, I'll be proud.

If you build a consulting business that generates $500K/year passive income, I'll be proud.

The only outcome that would disappoint me is if you let this destroy your relationship. You're siblings first, business partners second.

I love you both. Now go make me proud.

**Mom**
