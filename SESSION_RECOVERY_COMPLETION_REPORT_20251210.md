## 🔧 CRITICAL CORRECTIONS APPLIED

### 1. Dashboard Hierarchy (CORRECTED)

**Previous Understanding (INCORRECT):**
- God Mode: Site owner only ✅
- White-Label: Buyers, no dashboard access ❌
- End Users: No dashboard ❌

**Corrected Understanding:**
- **God Mode Dashboard:** Platform owner only - builds/configures everything
- **White-Label Dashboard:** Instance buyers - manage their branded instance
- **User Dashboards (TIERED):** All subscribers have dashboards
  - Tier 0: Premium dashboard with all features
  - Tier 1: Professional dashboard with standard features
  - Tier 2: Standard dashboard with basic features
  - Tier 3: Basic dashboard with limited features

**Key Insight:** Users NEED dashboards to manage book projects, return to work, track progress, and access tools. The tier determines WHAT features they have, not WHETHER they have a dashboard.

---

### 2. Zero-Hardcoding Philosophy (DOCUMENTED)

**Principle:** "NOTHING IS HARD CODED AND EVERYTHING IS CONFIGURABLE"

**Examples of Configurability:**
- Fonts (user chooses, not hardcoded)
- Page number ranges (user defines min/max)
- Word count limits (user decides)
- Formatting rules (user preference)
- Industry standards (recommended, not enforced)

**System Behavior:**
1. God Mode owner sets default configurations
2. System recommends industry best practices
3. Warns users when deviating from standards
4. User makes final decision
5. "User's choice, user's money, user's decision"

---

### 3. Platform Purpose (CLARIFIED)

**Core Functions:**
- Book writing, enhancement, and formatting
- Front matter & back matter preparation
- Marketing collateral generation
- Author promotion and landing pages
- Publishing workflow automation

**Key Integrations:**
- IngramSpark API (print-on-demand)
- Amazon KDP API (Kindle publishing)
- Other publishing platforms
- Distribution channel APIs
