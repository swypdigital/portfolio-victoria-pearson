## 2️⃣ COLD EMAIL SEQUENCES (3-EMAIL SERIES)

### SEQUENCE A: Acqui-Hire Pitch (For Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)

#### Email 1: The Hook (Send Monday AM)
**Subject:** "Built the most comprehensive Claude Code ecosystem—can we talk?"

```
[Name],

I'm Victoria Pearson. At 61, I taught myself AI and built 6 production systems using Claude:

• Claude OS: 180+ automation scripts + 12 daemons
• InterviewPlus: Multi-tenant HR SaaS (5,635 TypeScript files)
• GenCraft: Meta-generation engine (builds systems across any vertical)
• TokenCalc: AI cost tracking with patent-worthy forensic watermarking
• BookCraft: AI-augmented book creation pipeline
• LeadCraft: B2B lead extraction tool

Total portfolio value: $8M-25M (pre-revenue, estimated).

I'm not looking for funding. I'm looking for the right acqui-hire opportunity—someone who values this IP + wants me on the team.

Given [Company]'s focus on [specific thing they do], I think there's a natural fit. Would you be open to a 15-minute call this week?

Best,
Victoria Pearson
[LinkedIn URL]
[Portfolio URL - if ready]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Opens with credibility (age + self-taught = inspirational)
- Quantifies achievements (6 systems, dollar amounts)
- Shows you did research ("Given [Company]'s focus on...")
- Clear ask (15-minute call)

---

#### Email 2: The Reminder (Send Thursday, 3 days later)
**Subject:** "Re: Built the most comprehensive Claude Code ecosystem—can we talk?"

```
[Name],

Following up on my Monday email. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short.

Quick highlight: TokenCalc (one of my 6 systems) solves the "Perplexity Comet problem"—freemium abuse via shared Pro accounts. Our forensic watermarking system prevents this using multi-layer PDF manipulation.

Patent-worthy. Market-ready. 2-3 weeks to production integration.

If you're interested in an acqui-hire conversation (IP + hire me as Staff Engineer), let's schedule 15 minutes this week.

If not the right fit, totally understand. Just let me know so I can focus elsewhere.

Best,
Victoria
```

**Why This Works:**
- Reminds without being pushy
- Adds NEW value (TokenCalc detail they didn't see in Email 1)
- Gives them an out ("If not the right fit...")

---

#### Email 3: The Breakup (Send Tuesday, 5 days after Email 2)
**Subject:** "Closing the loop"

```
[Name],

Haven't heard back, so I'm assuming this isn't the right time. No worries!

Before I move on, here's what you'd be getting:

1. **Claude OS**: Production-ready developer framework (could be official Anthropic tooling)
2. **TokenCalc**: Forensic watermarking solves freemium abuse (licensable to other SaaS)
3. **GenCraft**: Meta-generation architecture (builds systems, not just code)
4. **Me**: Staff-level AI engineer who built all of this at 61

If anything changes, I'm here. Otherwise, wishing [Company] continued success.

Best,
Victoria

P.S. If you know someone else at [Company] who might be interested, I'd appreciate an intro.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Final attempt without desperation
- Summarizes value in 4 bullets (easy to skim)
- PS asks for referral (often works even if they're not personally interested)

## 3️⃣ JOURNALIST PITCHES (HARO + COLD OUTREACH)

### Template 3A: HARO Response
**Use When:** Responding to HARO queries about AI, career changes, ageism, tech

**Subject:** HARO Response: [Their Query Title]

```
Hi [Journalist Name],

I'm responding to your HARO query: "[Query Title]"

**My Credentials:**
Victoria Pearson, 61-year-old self-taught AI architect. In <12 months, I built 6 production AI systems (InterviewPlus, GenCraft, TokenCalc, BookCraft, LeadCraft, Claude OS) valued at $8M-25M.

**Relevant Quote for Your Article:**
"[Insert 2-3 sentence quote directly answering their query. Make it provocative, quotable, and specific.]"

Example:
"People ask how I learned AI at 61 with no tech background. The truth? AI democratized software development. You don't need a CS degree anymore—you need curiosity and 10-20 hours a day of practice. Age is an asset. Life experience gives you better product sense than a 22-year-old fresh out of bootcamp."

**Additional Context (if needed):**
[1-2 paragraphs expanding on your quote]

**Available for:**
- Phone interview (30 min)
- Email Q&A
- Photo/headshot (professional headshot attached)

**Contact:**
Victoria Pearson
[Phone]
[Email]
[LinkedIn]

Looking forward to contributing to your story!

Best,
Victoria
```

**Why This Works:**
- Responds directly to their query
- Provides ready-to-use quote (saves them time)
- Offers multiple interview formats
- Professional + helpful = they'll use you

### Template 3B: Cold Pitch to Tech Journalist
**Use When:** Proactively pitching your story to journalists who cover AI/tech/ageism

**Subject:** Story Idea: 61-Year-Old Built $20M AI Portfolio Solo

```
Hi [Journalist Name],

I'm Victoria Pearson, and I have a story I think [Publication] readers would love.

**The Hook:**
At 61, I taught myself AI and built 6 production systems worth $8M-25M in <12 months. Zero funding. Zero team. Just me + AI.

**Why This Matters:**
1. **Ageism narrative flip**: I'm living proof that "too old for tech" is a lie
2. **AI democratization**: You don't need a CS degree to build software anymore
3. **Hope for displaced workers**: If I can do this at 61, anyone can catch this window

**The Systems I Built:**
• InterviewPlus: Multi-tenant HR SaaS (5,635 TypeScript files)
• GenCraft: Meta-generation engine (patent potential)
• TokenCalc: AI cost tracker with forensic watermarking
• BookCraft, LeadCraft, Claude OS (production-ready)

**Angle Options for Your Article:**
1. "The 61-Year-Old Who Built a $20M Tech Portfolio—And You Can Too"
2. "How AI Is Creating a Second Chance for Workers Over 50"
3. "She Learned to Code at 61. Her Secret? AI."

**What I Can Offer:**
- Exclusive interview (phone/Zoom/in-person if you're in [City])
- Technical deep dive (screen share, demo live systems)
- Photos/headshots (professional)
- Access to my portfolio/documentation

**Deadline:**
No rush, but if you're writing about [topic they cover], I'd love to contribute.

Interested? Let's chat.

Best,
Victoria Pearson
[LinkedIn]
[Email]
[Phone]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Clear hook in subject line + opening
- Multiple story angles (lets them choose)
- Shows you read their work ("[Publication] readers")
- No-pressure timeline ("No rush")
