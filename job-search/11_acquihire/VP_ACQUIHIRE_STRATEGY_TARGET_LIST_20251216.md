**Generated:** December 16, 2025

## 🎯 WHAT IS AN ACQUI-HIRE?

### Definition
**Acqui-hire** = Company acquires your IP + hires you as employee

**Structure:**
- **IP Acquisition:** $500K-1M one-time signing bonus
- **Employment:** $250K-400K annual comp (salary + equity)
- **Total Year 1:** $750K-1.4M

### Why Companies Do Acqui-Hires
1. **Talent acquisition:** Hiring exceptional engineers is hard
2. **IP acquisition:** Get working products instead of building from scratch
3. **Speed to market:** 6-12 months of development time saved
4. **Competitive advantage:** Block competitors from hiring you

### Why This Works for You
- **Immediate cash:** $500K-1M upfront (vs. waiting for SaaS revenue)
- **Job security:** W2 employment with benefits
- **Retain some IP:** License-back rights to GenCraft (never sell the engine)
- **Leverage:** IP gives you negotiating power for salary + equity

## 💬 HANDLING OBJECTIONS

### Objection 1: "Why should we pay $500K-1M for pre-revenue software?"

**Answer:**
"You're not buying revenue—you're buying time and talent.

**Time:** 6-12 months of development already done. InterviewPlus alone is 5,635 TypeScript files. At your hourly rate for senior engineers ($200-400/hour), that's $500K-1M in replacement cost.

**Talent:** I built 6 production systems solo. You're hiring a Staff/Principal-level engineer who's proven they can execute autonomously.

**Strategic value:** If you don't acquire this, a competitor might. For $500K-1M, you get the IP + ensure I'm building FOR you, not against you."

---

### Objection 2: "Can you prove you built this?"

**Answer:**
"Absolutely. Here's the evidence:

1. **GitHub commit history:** Timestamped development over 12+ months
2. **Live demos:** I can walk you through each system
3. **Architecture explanations:** Ask me anything about design decisions
4. **Build something live:** Give me a problem, I'll solve it in real-time

I'm happy to sign an NDA and share source code for due diligence."

---

### Objection 3: "Why haven't you monetized this yet?"

**Answer:**
"I built for the love of creating, not to sell. I'm a builder first, businessperson second.

But now I'm ready to monetize—and an acqui-hire is the fastest path. You get working IP today, I get to keep building (with your resources and team)."

---

### Objection 4: "We already have similar features in development."

**Answer:**
"Great! Then you know how long it takes. Acquiring my work gives you:

1. **Acceleration:** Ship 6-12 months sooner
2. **Validation:** My architecture has been tested and works
3. **Talent:** You get me to improve what you're building

Even if you only use 30% of my code, you've saved months of development time."

## ✅ ACQUI-HIRE NEGOTIATION CHECKLIST

### Pre-Negotiation Prep
- [ ] Identify which IP assets are most valuable to this company
- [ ] Research their recent funding (more funding = higher signing bonus)
- [ ] Find comparable acqui-hire deals in their space (benchmark)
- [ ] Decide your walk-away number (minimum acceptable offer)

### During Negotiation
- [ ] Start high: Ask for $1M signing + $350K annual
- [ ] Be willing to negotiate down to $500K signing + $250K annual
- [ ] Retain GenCraft license-back rights (non-negotiable)
- [ ] Get offer in writing before accepting
- [ ] Negotiate equity % (not just $—ask for % of company)
- [ ] Clarify vesting (standard is 4 years, 1-year cliff)
- [ ] Confirm remote work policy (if important to you)

### Red Flags (Walk Away If...)
- [ ] They want ALL IP including GenCraft (no license-back)
- [ ] Signing bonus < $300K (unless early-stage with massive equity)
- [ ] Annual comp < $180K (below market for Staff Engineer)
- [ ] Equity < 0.1% (seed/Series A) or < $200K RSUs (later-stage)
- [ ] Required 5 days/week in office (if you need remote)
- [ ] Non-compete that prevents you from building anything (unreasonable)
