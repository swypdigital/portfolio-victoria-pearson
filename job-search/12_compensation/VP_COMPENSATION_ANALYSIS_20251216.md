---

## 💰 SECTION 2: TOTAL COMPENSATION BREAKDOWN

### **Understanding Total Comp Components:**

**1. Base Salary** (Guaranteed, paid biweekly/monthly)
- What you negotiate
- Used for mortgage applications, loans
- **Your target:** $170K-$220K

**2. Stock/Equity** (Vests over 4 years, typically)
- **Public companies (FAANG):** RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) = real value
- **Startups:** Stock options = lottery tickets (might be worth $0 or millions)
- **Typical vesting:** 25% year 1, then monthly or quarterly
- **Your target:** $40K-$80K/year (vested value)

**3. Bonus** (Annual, performance-based)
- Usually 10-20% of base
- Not guaranteed (but usually paid if company is healthy)
- **Your target:** $15K-$40K/year

**4. Benefits** (Not counted in "total comp" but valuable)
- Health insurance: $10K-20K/year value
- 401(k) match: 3-6% of salary = $5K-$13K/year
- PTO: 15-25 days (unlimited is often worse)
- **Total value:** $15K-$35K/year

**EXAMPLE: $250K Total Comp Breakdown**
- Base: $180K
- Stock (annual): $50K
- Bonus: $20K
- **Total Cash (Year 1):** $200K + $12.5K stock (25% vested) = $212.5K
- **Total Comp (4-year average):** $250K/year

---

### **Cash vs. Equity Trade-offs:**

**Option A: High Cash, Low Equity**
- Best for: Immediate needs, debt payoff, risk-averse
- Example: $200K base, $20K stock, $20K bonus = $240K total
- **Pros:** Guaranteed income, mortgage-friendly
- **Cons:** Miss upside if company grows

**Option B: Balanced**
- Best for: Most people
- Example: $180K base, $50K stock, $20K bonus = $250K total
- **Pros:** Upside potential + solid base
- **Cons:** Stock might be worth less (or more)

**Option C: High Equity, Lower Cash**
- Best for: Early-stage startups, high risk tolerance
- Example: $150K base, $100K stock (on paper), $10K bonus = $260K total
- **Pros:** Massive upside if company exits
- **Cons:** Stock might be worthless; hard to pay bills

**Your Situation (61 years old):**
Recommend **Option A or B**—prioritize cash over equity. You don't have 10 years to wait for an exit. Focus on: High base ($180K-$220K) + reasonable stock ($30K-$50K) + bonus ($15K-$30K).

## 🤝 SECTION 7: NEGOTIATION STRATEGY

### **The Victoria Pearson Negotiation Playbook:**

**NEVER accept first offer.** Here's why:
- Companies expect you to negotiate (first offer is 10-20% below their max)
- Even $10K more base = $40K over 4 years
- Stock negotiations can add $50K-$100K total comp

### **Step-by-Step Negotiation Process:**

**Step 1: Anchor High**
When asked "What are your salary expectations?":
- **WRONG:** "I'm open" or "What's the range?"
- **RIGHT:** "Based on my $8M-25M portfolio and AI-systems expertise, I'm targeting $200K-$240K base, $280K-$350K total comp for senior roles, or $240K-$280K base, $350K-$450K total for staff roles."

**Step 2: Get Written Offer First**
- **WRONG:** Negotiate verbally
- **RIGHT:** "That sounds great! Can you send the written offer so I can review all components?"

**Step 3: Ask for More (Always)**
Email template:
```
Thank you for the offer. I'm excited about [Company] and the opportunity to [specific impact you'll make].

After reviewing the offer, I'd like to discuss a few adjustments:

1. Base Salary: Given my $20M portfolio and AI-native systems expertise, I was targeting closer to $[+$20K]. Would $[NEW NUMBER] be possible?

2. Equity: The initial grant seems lower than market. Could we increase to $[+50% stock]?

3. Sign-On Bonus: To offset leaving potential consulting income ($200/hour), would a $[20K-50K] sign-on bonus be possible?

I'm confident I can deliver [specific value] and would love to find a compensation package that reflects that.

Can we schedule a call to discuss?
```

**Step 4: Use Competing Offers**
- **If you have multiple offers:** "I have another offer at $[higher number]. I prefer your company, but need to be close on comp."
- **If you don't:** "I'm in late-stage conversations with [Company X] and expect an offer soon. I'd love to move forward with you—can we close the gap?"

**Step 5: Don't Negotiate Small Things**
- Focus on: Base, stock, sign-on bonus
- Don't nickel-and-dime: PTO days, remote stipend, laptop specs

**Step 6: Get Everything in Writing**
- Verbal promises mean nothing
- Final offer letter = what you actually get

---

### **Common Negotiation Objections & Your Responses:**

**Objection:** "We can't go higher on base—it's outside our band."
**Response:** "I understand. Could we add a sign-on bonus or increase the equity grant to get closer to $[target total comp]?"

**Objection:** "You don't have a CS degree / only 1 year experience."
**Response:** "True—I don't have traditional credentials. But I built a $20M portfolio in 12 months that would take a 10-person team 3-5 years. I'm not asking for 10x comp—just market rate for the value I bring."

**Objection:** "This is our final offer."
**Response:** "I appreciate that. Would you be open to revisiting in 6 months based on performance?" (Then crush it and renegotiate)
